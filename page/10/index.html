        <p>2024-03-16 16:05<br>Now I am sure about my Hotspot in the Android could only cover small area of adjacent rooms. So now it is just the time to search about router devices.<br>I haven’t learn about router before, now I need the network to cover at least a whole building. So I need to search about the covering ability.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 16:25<br>Now I found guides about using linux device as router but without mentioning the covering ability.<br>And someone said Android hotspot could reach 800m.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 16:32<br>So dual band router could have better network, but I still need to figure out whether the coverage of Android device is sufficient.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/215025/how-to-use-android-device-as-router-without-cellular-connection">https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/215025/how-to-use-android-device-as-router-without-cellular-connection</a></p>
<p>2024-03-16 16:43<br>Since wt88047 could flash Archlinux, I wonder whether it could use openwrt to become a router. Now I still have no idea about how to increase the covering range of Android device.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 18:28<br>Now I searched about mesh router and had a quick glance of the router products. So forwarding network between buildings itself is difficult and nearly can’t done with just one router. And with the price consideration, I prefer to rent a VPS to use frp and scrap at the same time.<br>And I just realized that I could use USB to tether (First time to see the word with technological meaning) ipv6<br>network to my cp713, I will give it a try.</p>
<p>And I just searched that wt88047 supports 802.11 b&#x2F;gn wireless network, which I don’t recongized but I will try to make it a router. And with two Android router I should be able to have larger cover.</p>

<p>I just heared about ECS recently, short for “Elastic Container Service”. While VPS is short for “Virtual Private Server”, so I mixed them up in the previous blogs. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/vps">https://www.ibm.com/topics/vps</a><br>So they are all cloud server, I heared about VPS mostly in the blogs of proxy.<br>In a word, after searching, I think ECS is a new product which is more focused on the personal usage with more containers equipted. While VPS, I think, is more like a server which needs more setting up procedure.</p>

        <p>2024-03-16 12:29<br>Recently I found a more formal StreetView scraping repository in github, which uses wgs84 coordinate system as input. This is my first time to learn about different geo-coordinate systems and GIS.<br>The main reason is I want to use this to optimize my “clicking method”, which is very memory-consuming and today I found the point clicked in the map panel always has some offset from the real place. It causes deviation but just fine when the whole area is to be scracped.<br>Actually, my first try to get StreetView ID is also to call the api with coorindate data, but the deviation was too big by simply cutiing off the number of decimal to reduce the for loop. So this inspires me maybe a certain geo-coordinate system will help. And with the generated coordinate data, I can remove the for loop.<br>I tried to find which geo-coordinate system is with 14-figure decimal which is used in my target api and I think this will reduce deviation, but I didn’t find one.</p>
<p>This is my first time to learn about GIS software, so QGIS is a good choice and I feel it’s a litte big for now I just want to get some points in wgs84.</p>
<p>I think I could try to use the coordinates to optimize my scrap scripts, still with some deviation.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 12:55<br>So now I will try some geo-cooordinate system to compare the accuracy. By the way, learning some knowledge of the field about the target data is helpful.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 13:34<br>So one step before use other’s script is to modify the input format. It is apparant very formal for its csv has more information than just coordinate and the in-process reports which are all not in my scripts.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 18:44<br>Now I finally have a quite place. In the afternoon, I found after yesterday’s trying, I have became fimiliar with vim, which helped me use ECS smoothly. So I upload the scrapying script to ECS, using vim to modify it from Windows path to linux path and began my first ECS sccraping.</p>
<p>It turns out there is still some devitation of the target places. I simplied the script by changing input with only coordinates and removing the prints. This is my first time to pull a repository and modify the code, it is indeed more convenient to have editing urls and finding StreetView params done ahead.</p>
<p>Now the script just needs a list of coordinates as input, I will try QGIS to find how to generate coordinates of areas.<br>One more important thing is that the script doesn’t include the time machine function of the map api, which have year choices, which I will dive into. In the past few days I was occupied with devices and chores, now I will continue scraping.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 19:04<br>Ah, of crouse I alse need to fix hexo with new themes.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 19:34<br>Well, I just found the images downloaded by the script are not with enough resolution, so I need to make a improve with tile images.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 14:45<br>Well, it is really a fortune to not have noise. And it is sometimes bothersome to find it’s more effetive when there is no courses.<br>2024-03-16 14:56<br>It’s hard to write summary or scripts under noise, so it becomes the alerms to do chores.</p>

<p>2024-03-16 10:22<br>First solution, is to use ftp with another VPS, which is kinda unconvevient and Im not sure whether it is safe.<br>Second solution, is to use IPv6. While after checking, it turns out the eduroam doesn’t support IPv6.</p>
<p>Well, my mobile data has IPv6 but not suitbable for my scraping.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 10:40<br>Third solution, using an VPN in a local device to forward the WiFi. Now I have used my old Android device rooted to connect to eduroam and use Hotspot to run the hotspot at the same time.<br>Well, it is still amazing to finally run cp713’s shell in my Windows desktop, despite of a little latency.<br>What I concern more is the battery and heating of the Hotspot when heavily use or take around. So I will test this and maybe a newer Android device or a NUC will be better.</p>
<p>Now, I finally step into the ssh world.</p>

<p>Recently, I am getting busier and less quite time.<br>Actually, I wanted to use justice as title at first, for Code Geass has a lysic named “Love is justice”, which I feel not so reasonable. The proper explanation I came up is it is named for L.L.’s love for his sister and then for C.C., and all the characters’ stories. Back to 2020, in which period I watched all the Broadcasting plays of Code Geass, I found its final theme is return to happiness. In this way, the song’s name will be proper.<br>while after searching, I found justice seems more about laws. So I changed to “right”. We are be told what’s right all the time. Rules from the rigor context of science are of crouse right under the current technologies. But for society, which I think is much more complex for it’s too real. Every formula has its conditions, while in reality, there could be any condition. So this makes me to wonder how useful when we are told about rules outside of the science. In 2020, I thought rules have usually not stated conditions in a specific environment. And it is concluded from the environment and only directly useful for the enviroment with unspecified time scope. And it is of crouse with the limitation of the individual which concluded it, beacme popular when it is useful for majority and there are always outliers. And I thought just the outliers with good development could bring the creativeness, for if everyone follow the same rules it will be too stable.</p>

        <p>2024-03-16 10:04<br>Conclusion:<br>Just need to move the “&#x2F;etc&#x2F;ssh&#x2F;sshd_not_to_be_run”, then setup sshd_config and Firewall.<br>With the correct ip address and avaliable network, ssh will work fine.</p>
<p>2024-03-14 22:33<br>After apt installed ssh, I followed the guides to set the ssh_config. But both “sudo &#x2F;etc&#x2F;init.d&#x2F;ssh start” and “systemctl start ssh” could not work.<br>These two commands did not throw error, but whenever using “&#x2F;etc&#x2F;init.d&#x2F;ssh status” to check, the result is always<br>Actice: inactive (dead)<br>Condition: start condition failed</p>
<p>I searched and had tried “systemctl enable ssh.service” and “ufw allow ssh”, but both didn’t work.</p>
<p>2024-03-14 22:45<br>Having another look, I found in the next line:<br>ConditionPathExists!&#x3D; &#x2F;etc&#x2F;ssh&#x2F;sshd_not_to_be_run was met</p>
<p>Well, it is a double negation so I had not noticed it earlier. So now just mv it and ssh finally active.<br>However, it threw “Connetion time out”. </p>
<p>2024-03-14 22:50<br>Using “nestuat “, I found my cp713 doesn’t have Port 22, I think changing the Port number should solve it.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 6:54<br>Now I have changed the Port setting, but my Windows bash still throws “ssh: connect to host 192.168.122.1 port 22: Connection timed out”</p>
<p>2024-03-15 7:01<br>I searched it may due to ssh key, and I also want to use id key to login, so I will use it.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 7:07<br>After using “ssh key-gen”, my cp713 threw:<br>&#x2F;etc&#x2F;ssh&#x2F;ssh_congfig: terminating, 5 bad configuration options</p>
<p>2024-03-15 7:20<br>Well, looks I wrote the wrong command. But it dosen’t throw error in the first time. Now I see “&#x2F;etc&#x2F;ssh” also has a ssh_config, which was changed by me yesterday according to the guides.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 7:35<br>Weird, I searched a guide and I indeed find there is no Openssh program is my Windows’s settings, while I can use cmd to open ssh, so ssh is still installed.</p>
<p>I have followed the guide to set Port for ssh but still couldn’t connect.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 7:50<br>Now I have connected two devices to the same WiFi but still time out, I think the problem is within Windows.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 12:10<br>According to a blog, I tried changing to my hotspot, again time out. So the problem is not in network.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 12:22<br>Now I have checked Firewall and clicked permissions for Openssh. Then I used cmd to connect with this:<br>Bad permissions. Try removing permissions for user: LAPTOP\pvz (S-1-5-21-3741729915-1225447729-2067596728-1003) on file C:&#x2F;Users&#x2F;Lenovo&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;config.<br>Bad owner or permissions on C:\Users\Lenovo&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;config</p>
<p>2024-03-15 12:27<br>I removed the user but cmd result is still “time out”.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 12:41<br>To locate the problem, I used my cell phone with juicessh to connect to cp713 and again could not connect. So now the problem is still in cp173.<br>And I noticed that, actually I had noticed it in the morning. Whenever I try to connect to cp713’s server, its WiFi will show “Connected but no Internet access”.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 13:22<br>I tried to add “Ciphers” and “MACs”, which I haven’t learned yet to sshd_config, but still no use.<br>Now I found a guide about iptables and indeed I don’t see Port in the domian line. This seems promising.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 13:38<br>It is weird that my cp713 seems to doesn’t have Port 22.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 13:43<br>Now I searched more about firewall. And a guide said to use ufw which seems reasonable:<br>“sudo ufw allow ssh<br> sudo ufw allow portnumber&#x2F;tcp<br> sudo ufw enable”<br>I tried but still no use. Also I don’t know the relationship between ufw and iptables. I used “netstat alpn” but results did not contain ssh port. </p>
<p>2024-03-15 13:54<br>So using “netstat -anp|grep sshd” could show the listening port of ssh.<br>And I installed the “openssh*” but still no use.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 14:00<br>Using “sudo iptables -L” can display all the (now I don’t what these are)things related to firewall and ports. I noticed the contents become much longer after using ufw command.<br>Now I can be sure about the problem is in firewall setting, for the<br>“Chain LIBVIRT_FWI (1 references)<br> target<br> ACCEPT<br> REJECT reject-with icmp-port-unreachable”<br>But now I don’t recognize all of these.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 14:09<br>I searched for how to allow the port, but my cp713 doesn’t have “&#x2F;etc&#x2F;sysconfig&#x2F;iptables”</p>
<p>2024-03-15 14:16<br>Well, I changed the port of ssh, made “sudo ufw allow ssh” “sudo ufw enable”.<br>But in iptables, REJECT is still “reject-with icmp-port-unreachable”. So I think I just need to  change the iptables.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 14:29<br>After trying commands and searching, I found iptables could not work well in Debian.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/dappnode/DNP_DAPPMANAGER/issues/699">https://github.com/dappnode/DNP_DAPPMANAGER/issues/699</a><br>One blog says iptables in Debian will not be save, while I restarted cp713 to find the result of “sudo iptables -L” is still the same.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 14:42<br>Well, Im really confused about this. I followed the guide to use “iptables -A INPUT -p tcp –dport portnumber -j ACCEPT” and “sudo iptables-save&gt; &#x2F;etc&#x2F;iptables.up.rules”<br>But it threw “Permission denied.”, this is the first time I saw “Permission denied” with a root user.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 14:58<br>Ah! Finally I changed host from 192. to 127. and then it finally connected.<br>But I don’t know why when I typing password, the bash didn’t receive the input.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 15:06<br>Oh, so ssh doesn’t show the password when inputting. But it throws “Permission denied, please try again.”, I decide to try whether using key could connect.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 18:41<br>I made ssh keys and transfered to Windows, connecting with the error:<br>“Server refused our key”<br>So there is still something wrong with cp713.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 19:01<br>AH, not again! I searched and tried different types of key, I also used “# restorecon -R -v &#x2F;home”, but none of them worked.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 21:08<br>Well, I found threre are “_host_key” files in “&#x2F;etc&#x2F;ssh, I think they are the pre-setted keys. So I “chmod 777 &#x2F;etc&#x2F;ssh” and copied id key to my Windows desktop, but it still could not access.<br>I tried “ssh-add key” in Git Bash to add the identity, but no use.<br>And Im confused why the 192. address is set to always reject by cp713 while 127. address could be requested.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 21:40<br>Tried “chown $USER:$USER ~&#x2F;.ssh -R” but no use.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 21:48<br>Tried editing &#x2F;etc&#x2F;ssh&#x2F;sshd_config to remove StrictModes &#x2F;etc&#x2F;init.d&#x2F;ssh reload, no use.<br>So the problem should not in config.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 22:28<br>So problem is within the Chromeos.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://superuser.com/questions/1513228/how-can-i-ssh-into-chrome-os/1598955?r=SearchResults#1598955">https://superuser.com/questions/1513228/how-can-i-ssh-into-chrome-os/1598955?r=SearchResults#1598955</a><br>But the url seems a bit out of date for its talking about Crostini.</p>
<p>2024-03-15 22:39<br>I noticed that the Port Forwarding function in ChromeOS requests the port to be above 1024, so I change my ssh port above 1024. But this time both password and key threw “Access denied”.<br>And I followed a guide to set the </p>
<p>2024-03-15 22:47<br>I serached the Chrome Forum, it is weird there are all 10 years ago.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.chromebookforum.com/search/1937/?q=ssh&o=relevance">https://www.chromebookforum.com/search/1937/?q=ssh&amp;o=relevance</a></p>
<p>This is my first time to learn about Port Forwarding, seems better than the current situation.<br>So I tried “ssh -L”, but still “Received disconnect  Too many authentication failures”</p>
<p>2024-03-15 22:53<br>Oh I forgot the Port Forwarding is in another wlan address, but now the bash stucked.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 8:46<br>I manually set the ListenAddress to 192. ip, but resulted with “Connection time out”.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 8:52<br>I tried to set ListenAddress to wlan0, but failed with journalctl “Bind failed: Cannot assign requested address”.<br>Im confused since there is a Port Forwarding function with this wlan0.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 8:58<br>I searched this error is for running out of ports, so I used “sysctl -a |grep port_range” to use a port within the range but no use.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 9:12<br>OH, so 127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0 is mostly within the host computer. AH, I should learn some pre-knowledge before doing this.<br>So now the useful error is “Connection time out”.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 9:22<br>So LISTEN 0.0.0.0 is open to the external, while LiSTEN 127.0.0.1 is just within the local.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 9:34<br>AHH, finally I successfully connected to my cp713 with the ip address of the WiFi. But now it only works within my hotspot, not under the eduWiFi.<br>Well, I could use another device and Hotspot to forwarding the eduWiFi but this will be kinda unconvenient.<br>So after all, the development docs is the most useful, mainly beacuse I know nothing about Network.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://chromeos.dev/en/web-environment/port-forwarding#:~:text=ChromeOS%E2%80%99s%20built-in%20port%20forwarding%20allows%20you%20to%20open,This%20will%20open%20up%20the%20Port%20forwarding%20screen">https://chromeos.dev/en/web-environment/port-forwarding#:~:text=ChromeOS%E2%80%99s%20built-in%20port%20forwarding%20allows%20you%20to%20open,This%20will%20open%20up%20the%20Port%20forwarding%20screen</a>.</p>
<p>2024-03-16 9:46<br>Well, still excited. So now I finally figured out the “Connection time out” is due to the eduroam I used. I searched eduroam restrict ports, so I will try to find out if there are avaliable ports.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://superuser.com/questions/1375894/cannot-ssh-to-my-remote-server-from-university-network">https://superuser.com/questions/1375894/cannot-ssh-to-my-remote-server-from-university-network</a></p>
<p>2024-03-16 9:55<br>Well, I didn’t find how to check the ports of a WiFi. And now all the eduroam WiFi could not forward my ssh connection (I finally know what forwarding means). So now I will use Hotspot. But now I only have old Android devices which will be indeed “hot” and this will depend on the WiFi’ range.<br>So I still need to find out how to connect two computers within different networks.</p>

<p>Well, since I have began to endure both immediate, long-lasting and fixed-time noises since 2018. I have been rather fimiliar with how to deal with these.<br>For immediate, not long-lasting nise, changing to another place may cost more time. So it is better to prepare some chores (oops I misspelled it as chaos in the former blog) and tasks that need less thinking. For me rencently, I have an api which closed the serach by name option and only left the clicking panel function so it is difficult to use selenium to specify the route.<br>For long-lasting, fixed-time or too loud noise, changing to another place will be good choice, also this could avoid sitting still roo long.</p>
