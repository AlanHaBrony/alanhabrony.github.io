I had thought about the inherent limit of the binary mechanism, too detetministic with no randomness like human brain as a complicated bioelectric system. Then I thought the Quantum computers might be the better solution, but again too advanced.</p>

        <p>2024-05-04 13:40<br>Today I got the secondhand jacket. Well, first of all, if there was any new mlp featured clothes I would not look at secondhand clothes. There are a few spots which need close look and the jacket is indeed not old. The only problem is the musty smell which came from the poor storing conditions in the humid place where the owner live.</p>
<p>2024-05-04 13:40<br>I read about some fungi is harmful so I need to search about this. However, this jacket is the only one with just the right size for me. But now it is quiet time for some reading.</p>
<p>2024-05-05 08:12<br>Things could be strange but still occur. Two old women brusted in the classroom and just walked from the front door to the back door to exit, leaving all the bother, opened door and me to searching about the Apostille.</p>
<p>2024-05-05 08:29<br>A place is horrible with people shouting outside the rooms, but it is still educational just because there are classes.</p>
<p>2024-05-05 10:34<br>It is bothersome to have noise in the morning and finally being quiet near the noon, at which time one has to choose between quietness with hunger or a not crowed lunch.</p>
<p>2024-05-06 07:50<br>My main concern is whether the musty smell is harmful.</p>

<p>2024-05-06 21:23<br>I got another secondhand cloth, which has no spot but still a slight musty smell.　I think this might be a common case since this featured series came out in 2020.</p>

        <p>2024-05-03 09:41<br>I need around 1T in total for all the image files of my devices + scraped data, usually I use HDDs for its lower price than SSD. But after comparing the prices of secondhand 2.5-inch HDDs with Cloud Drive’s VIP, I found Cloud Drive in fact has the lowest price for 3 months’ use. The only problem is whether the Cloud Drive can be set as webdrvie or just uploading.</p>
<p>2024-05-05 14:24<br>For the sake of privacy, I use winRAR to compress and I want to make sure the files are safe without losing data.</p>
<p>2024-05-05 14:55<br>So choosing the “Storage mode” in winRAR could packup the files without compresing.</p>

        <p>2024-05-03 07:07<br>I use a note app in Android which saves all the notes as .md file in emulated&#x2F;0&#x2F;Android&#x2F;data&#x2F;{app’s folder}, which could be accessed only with permission after Android 10. I need two devices to extract the files, one is Android 11 without tf card slot with around 4G’s size, the other is Android 12 with tf card slot with 2G in size. (Mi5 is not included since its data is in image file.)</p>
<p>2024-05-03 07:16<br>I tried to use OTG to transfer the files but the battary was not enough and the copied file had a size larger than 15G. I think tf card will help a lot at least it could finish the transfering process. So now I need either a method to pull files in &#x2F;Android&#x2F;data via adb or a USB Uub which support USB2.0 with charger, regardless of the problem of file size.</p>
<p>2024-05-03 08:16<br>So the weed eradicator starts at 08:00 and this is really some push.<br>For the problem of file size, I think a tool like fastcopy will help.</p>

        <p>2024-05-02 15:17<br>Well, the weed eradicators bewtween buildings are really horrible. And I just need to search about how to clone HDDs with laptop, since I am not sure about the reliablity and performance of the old desktop with winXP. (Q1 Today I found it is convenient to mark the questions and assign numbers.)</p>
<p>2024-05-02 15:24<br>I began with comparision between the Hard Drive Docking Station and the Hard Drive Enclosure. After searching among the posts, I chose the Toolfree because it has the best user feedback and its charger is enough for 4T HDD. In fact I had bought a Toolfree Hard Drive Enclosure eight months ago and it stuck once with my HC320 but didn’t cause any damage.</p>
<p>2024-05-02 15:34<br>All my laptops are only with one USB port, so I need to use a USB Hub. I have one Philips USB Hub but I don’t know whether it is safe to connect two HDDs with laptop.(Q2)</p>
<p>2024-05-02 22:52<br>So it is said SATA is not as durable as USB with around one thousand times use. I only use HDDs to write once and check the data every year so it is fine.</p>

<p>2024-05-05 13:44<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sci.news/physics/information-fifth-state-matter-10638.html">https://www.sci.news/physics/information-fifth-state-matter-10638.html</a><br>So it hasn’t been tested. And I am doubt that how could information be transformed into physical matter. And there is no Mathematical poof supporting this. (So I misspelled Mathematics in the past blogs.)</p>
<p>2024-05-05 13:58<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2023/10/10/uk-physicist-new-research-living-in-computer-simulation/71130887007/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2023/10/10/uk-physicist-new-research-living-in-computer-simulation/71130887007/</a><br>So DNA could be said to be an example of information transforming to physical matter. Well, the process is typically considered as a biological development with the guidance of DNA, so I don’t think it’s a proper example of information-mass tranformation. Also DNA does not disappear after the process.</p>
<p>2024-05-05 14:08<br>In my opinion, a successful Physics theory always has hard Mathematics proof supporting it. So this conjecture is still a fancy thought.</p>
<p>2024-05-05 14:46<br>“Each day on Earth we generate 500<em>106 tweets, 294</em>109 emails, 4<em>106 gigabytes of Facebook data, 65</em>109 WhatsApp messages, and 720,000 hours of new content added daily on YouTube.”<br>This data inspires me, as for the growth rate, infotmation is exploding in the sense that the progress could easily be infinite, unlike the life and death cycle of the normal matters.</p>
<p>2024-05-05 15:02<br>For example, if we record or make logs of any undergoing process, and even recursively record or make logs of the recording process, this could repeat infinitely with enough storage. The limit is in physical storage capacity other than the information itself. </p>
<p>2024-05-05 15:08<br>So as a conclusion, numbers are meaningless for information without removing the duplicates.</p>
<p>2024-05-05 15:12<br>Information and data provide a bridge between the reality or real entity with the internal world, so I believe there will be some finding deepen the knowledge of information.</p>
<p>2024-05-05 15:22<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2023/10/10/uk-physicist-new-research-living-in-computer-simulation/71130887007/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2023/10/10/uk-physicist-new-research-living-in-computer-simulation/71130887007/</a><br>I think the similiarity cannot accont for support without certain kind of equavalence. And “empirical evidence” makes no sense in the fields of theory or conjecture.</p>
<p>2024-05-05 15:40<br>I think this conjecture in fact reiterates the vacuut of Physics in minds. And this remind me of the definition of information as data with useful meanings. So after all, information is related to the observer but not fully subjective.</p>

        <p>2024-05-01 21:31<br>Sometimes people like to say “He&#x2F;She changed the world&#x2F;game.”, while as the famous paradox, is He&#x2F;She really changed the world or it is the World shaped him&#x2F;her to change the world. In this question I prefer the later. Since when we talk about the history or events, we need a specific person to analyse. Well, does the specialness really matter? It’s related to generality and uniqueness. Since similarities are very common from DNA inside a person to the social environment outside, there are always many people of the same kind. But there will never be two person being the same, even if with cloning technique, the two individuals cannot maintain the same since there will not be two environments with no difference except for the “Parallel universe” which will conflict with the cloning setting, and once the two individuals know the existance of the other they have already been different, just like the movie Moon (2009).</p>
<p>2024-05-01 21:57<br>So I think the critical figures are “selected by the history”, in the sense he&#x2F;she had the environment to develop the thoughts and skills, then as a member of the similiar group and just had the opportunity and a little random luck to stand 0ut at the phase transiation. So before the phase transiation there could be several possibilities, but the event only had fixed number of positions which were decided by the condition at that moment.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 22:09<br>I think it is easy to see the formation of a certain group is deterministic, because the group were grew within the similiar historical background and soical environment as the development of the social productivity. Then the specific individual part is more random as in the statistics behavior of Quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>2024-05-02 07:31<br>So the key point is whether two formation can be exactly the same, or whether a process&#x2F;formation can rigorly recur. Since there are too many factors if we try to model all the details and again the one-direction property of the time arrow, I think this is the core difference between theory and reality, which might be not feasible.</p>
<p>2024-05-02 07:54<br>Back to determinism, because there are too many deterministic process in theory and reality and as the above consideration, we cannot use experiments to verify whether there can be different results for the same initia state. So again this is a question out of the testing abilities.</p>
<p>2024-05-02 08:04<br>By thinking, it is certain that the wills, wishes and thoughts guide a person’s behaviours, decisions and therefore the path of life. So in a purely ideal assumption, a will or wish can come true immediately and without any deviation. The difference is brought by the reality. Purely ideal assumption cannot be deterministic because it totally discount the reality.</p>
<p>2024-05-02 08:16<br>As a explanation of being deterministic, I think it is equavalent to a model with which if we input all the initial states and specify all the parameters then it can output the next state. I used to think this is a generalization in the 1800s without enough research in uncertainty. Regardless of the difficulty of full details, this leads the question to whether the uncertainty is deterministic, which seems contradictory. But the point is whether the uncertainty is really a property or in fact due to lack of deeper understanding. When I learned Probability and Statistics, I thought it is not directly useful when making decisions as the theory is based on the past observations and the enough sample size for CLT. So I think limit is in fact a compromise between theory and reality and because of which there can be various differences or deviations.</p>
<p>2024-05-02 08:32<br>As a cursory conclusion, I think it is deterministic if we have enough or all the information, initial states, variables, parameters and the ability to calculate based on all the inputs. And this brought another thought, if this condition was met then we could build a full detailed simulation of the reality. This made me wonder whether we could “build” a parallel universe under the assumption, and whether our universe is in fact built as such.</p>
<p>2024-05-02 09:06<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.inverse.com/science/is-reality-a-simulation#:~:text=There%20is%20some%20evidence%20suggesting%20that%20our%20physical,reality%20world%20will%20be%20based%20on%20information%20processing">https://www.inverse.com/science/is-reality-a-simulation#:~:text=There%20is%20some%20evidence%20suggesting%20that%20our%20physical,reality%20world%20will%20be%20based%20on%20information%20processing</a>.<br>I didn’t search about these fancy theories for a long time. For the first time I know about the information physics and the relationship between mass and information. Well, this is reasonable, since I think Physics needs new standards of experimenting and testing. And it is easy to understand the encoding equavalence between information and electrics.</p>
<p>2024-05-02 10:14<br>My question is how the simulation hypothesis explain the differences between theory and reality, since the real conditioins are much rougher with all kinds of random noise, which should not occur in the “future code or program” unless on purpose.</p>

        <p>2024-05-01 18:26<br>When I had the luck and plenty of time to read about Mathmatics. I found at a certain point the complexity of Mathmatics in abstraction exceed the common sense of a normal person without modern academic training. As for me, Abstract Algebra, Complex Analysis and Formal Language are fine with enough efforts to read and understand. While Algebraic Geometry exceeded my understanding scope in 2020. I thought this was due to lack of enough training and partly the translation issue since my English skill was not senior in 2020. Also I found it was hard to find some analogue concepts to help understanding.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 19:01<br>This made me wonder that whether the modern Mathmatics would “classic” in the future. Now the Mathmatics in the 1600s are classified as Class Mathmatics and taught as junior level. Indeed these are very concrete because this is a period basicly from 0 to 1, and all the concepts and methods are from the direct observation and experience. Then Caculus occurred in the 1700s with the prosperity in the nature science. I think this is also based on the observations or experiments, but began to look deeper inside with analysis techniques. </p>
<p>2024-05-01 19:16<br>Due to the inherent property of Mathmatics as results and process of human minds, Mathmatics gradually went further without the limitation of observations and experiments required in nature science. I think this phase transition is not linear and therefore the gap of understanding may not narrow down automately.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 19:25<br>Several examples, especially results in Combinatorics and Graph theory, had showed the power of Mathmatics when the theoretical results were linked with suitable real life models. This rise the question whether every Mathmatics result has its correspondence in the reality, since after all Mathmatics, as well as thoughts, come from the reality. If so, the adjacent questioin is what are the correspondences of the modern Mathmatics theory? As a simple guess, sicne Mathmatics had went further than the nature science, I think the modern Mathmatics might find corrrespondence in the future’s nature science such as Physics, which is under the assumption of a one-to-one mapping.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 19:42<br>Reality is always harder than ideal. This rise another question that whether there is a upper bound or final limit of human being’s observation range or ability, which will cause the theories cannot be verified. Since the development of nature science seems slowing down, compared with the previous prosperity. And what will the role of Mathmatics be if this came true?</p>
<p>2024-05-01 19:52<br>Another question, as for the growth rate amount of the knowledge, will the knowledge be compressed such putting Bachelor’s courses down into the secondary school? Since otherwise the education years should grow as the amount of knowledge and research grow. Unless there are some kind of evolution in the education, such as with more digital assistance to reduce the remembering efforts and AI tools to reform the education and examination.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 20:01<br>So even though “we are in a rapidly developing modern society”, the development of science seems still very slow without significant breakthrough and the pace of the social system seems slower.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 20:12<br>More about obervation limitation, for example, whether there are higher dimension? As a hot topic in scientific fictions, we are 3-dimension creatures living in a one-direction time arrow. So we have the physical freedom but limited in the time axis. Well, in fact I always wonder, since 2020, what’s the dimension number of human brain? Since our thoughts can move freely in the time axis, again out of the reality. Obviously this question might not have an answer since there are no observations or experiments we can conduct to test it. So this again rises a question that, whether something really doesn’t exist or just because we human being cannot observe or verify it? However, from practical aspect, these two conditions could be equavalent. And it seems leading to a matter of definition and will come back to the limitation of human being.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 20:32<br>Well, the key point in this confusion is still the science. Since science has made plenty of achievements and breakthrough, much of which had surprised and updated the commen sense, it is the frontier of human knowledge and therefore the potential answer to all the confusion. Right now, I am limited in the time arrow, just like all the human being, limited wihin the current knowledge scope and try to think to figure out some questions out of the range.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 20:43<br>In fact, I thought thinking about this kind of question is useless in a practical view and it indeed is. But if we just think about the questions with certain answers, the process will be replaced by searching and browsering. So this should be the actual difference of research and real life, one is at the frontier and trying to expand the knowledge range of human being, while the other is accumulating and developing in the known range. These seem to be irrevalent, while in fact with the overall development reached a certain degree, there will be more investment and people devoted into research, especially when there are enough practical demand. So after all, the final answer might be just keep developing.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 21:13<br>Last but not least, at least for children, I was afraid of darkness when I was a kid, then I gradually realized if I really found something, it definitely will be a breakthrough or new finding. Then the situation became either I will be as usual or I will have the honours luck of being the first witness of some scentific finding. It is interesting as the difference between being nervous and being bold with curiosity.</p>

        <p>2024-05-01 16:35<br>From my experience, within a quiet environment and recalling good memories will significantly reduce the pressure level, bring similiar feelings and sometime make one sleepy-ish. Haven’t done any search, I think this is related to some brain wave. </p>
<p>2024-05-01 16:56<br>Since good memories have positive effects, it is nature to ask how to recall more. As memories can be reminded, it is helpful to find reminders like items, photos, even smell, taste and the weather in the period. And the similiar stories or a frined’s narration will also help to remind.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 17:09<br>Especially, due to the relative stability of places and the periodicity of the weather, the scenes in the memories could sometimes recur, which also applies to the similiarity and periodicity in the social life. This explains the flashback when back to the old places. And I found sometimes the reminding is not clear and result in a similiar feeling such as being happy or sad which seems came from nowhere. Moreover, I think this has some similiarity as the Biographical films, in the sense of making recurrence.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 17:23<br>From the aspect of mechanism, I think the function of memorizing and reminding is originally trained by the need of survival, with which lives can learn from the experience and even use similiarities to generalize the gained information or experience to adapt to the new environment or changes of the environment.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 17:38<br>In a higher level, I think memories are also part of the origin of feelings, thoughts and creativity. Because memories provide a space of non-reality, with which one could compare and therefore make judgements and add new knowledge based on the developed mindset or knowledge set. As for creativity, I think the not-precise proterty and similarity mechanism contribute to the creating process, since again this make a inconsistency or difference between ideas and the reality. In the common sense, this presents as creative people are often more ideal.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 17:54<br>By the way, people usually appreciate creativity while seldom appreciate ideal or not realistic. But is there really a clear cut between creativity and being ideal. People often just judge from the outcome. And this indeed make sense, since the thoughts and ideas of an individual can be arbitrary and couldn’t really be judged until it had turned into real outcome.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 18:05<br>But as for the mechanism behind memory, I haven’t read articles or textbooks about it and this is out of the range of thinking, whithout knowledge and observation. I know this mechanism is general regardless of the levels of the lives and I know sencitists had found the related brain areas. Also, I can presume this field is advanced, since if it was well-studied then AI will be more general and more like intellegent entity other than tools.</p>

        <p>2024-05-01 08:51<br>So now it is the time from which the building is likely to be quiet. Now I know the fixed desks and chairs are important for a good environment for the classrooms. I have to say it is ridiculous to gather many old women living in the building and give them cleaning trollies to circling around to “clean” every room with nothing to clean. Well, I know saying ridiculous is in fact knowing nothing behind or refusing to know about.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 09:08<br>During the rise and fall, I had the chance to get around with and therefore observe a very wide range of people. From the top Mathmatics student in the top university, to the people in undeveloped rural of the undeveloped town, which are near the bottom of the society.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 09:19<br>I can relate to the passion of the Mathmatics student when understanding fancy Math tricks or theories, I used to be there. But it is hard for me when every day I need to try to find a quiet place and prepare for the sudden noise if I want to be in a room with desks. It’s a matter of environment and individuals, since a place indeed will not necessarily be maintained quiet if there is nearly nobody in the spare time.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 09:34<br>More generally, people are concerned with work, earning, housing and children. And I found the degree to which a person can concerned more than these general aspects usually reflects the education, thoughts and the social class. Since these general aspects are all necessary to some degree and will “come to” people even without active preparation.</p>
<p>2024-05-01 09:47<br>Most people are in-between, which I think is a process of development of society and humanity. For individual aspect, my opinion is keep going with the balance between the ideal and reality, and always have preparations if the disturbance is with high probability.</p>
