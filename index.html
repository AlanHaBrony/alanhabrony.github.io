        <p>2024-05-09 12:30<br>Viewing the positions of PhD in Mathematics, I found the current main topics are 1. Algebraic Geometry, 2. Topology, 3. Combinatorics (and Quantum information), 4. (Dynamic) Networks, 5. Arithmetic Geometry and 6. Probability and Statistics&#x2F;Machine Learning.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 12:46<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://euromathsoc.org/jobs">https://euromathsoc.org/jobs</a><br>So this is where to find PhD positions.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 12:52<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.phdportal.com/search/phd/mathematics/europe">https://www.phdportal.com/search/phd/mathematics/europe</a><br>Based on the number of positions, EU has the most PhD positions, slightly more than NA. While by country US and UK are the most.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 13:02<br>So “A postdoc is a temporary research position after a PhD that prepares young researchers for their academic career.”, this explains the restrict in age. But for me, PhD isn’t a prudent choice to start my career.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 13:11<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.scribbr.com/graduate-school/masters-vs-phd/#:~:text=As%20research%20degrees%2C%20PhDs%20are%20usually%20intended%20to,university%20professor%20upon%20the%20completion%20of%20their%20degree">https://www.scribbr.com/graduate-school/masters-vs-phd/#:~:text=As%20research%20degrees%2C%20PhDs%20are%20usually%20intended%20to,university%20professor%20upon%20the%20completion%20of%20their%20degree</a>.<br>I love Mathematics and I appreciate doing research, but devoting five years in pure Mathematics with less salary could only be a choice after I had settled down with some earning.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 13:19<br>Since Im at the crossing now, I want to make a choice which could support both my career and love for Mathematics. Viewing the requirements of the positions, I have to say my BSc for career is insufficient. After all, how could a BSc other than Mathematics offer Algebra courses.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 13:29<br>As for my knowledge in Mathematics, I had great scores in Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics and Probability theory and Statistics, which are all the Mathematics I can get from a CSE BSc.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 13:34<br>Besides the academic courses, I only have books to read. I had read and got a good understanding of Real Analysis, Ramsey theory, Counting theory, basic Complex Analysis, Projective Geometry, Multi-version Geometry, Point-set Topology, Abstract Algebra, Number theory, Machine Learning, Heuristic Optimization, Graph theory, The Book, Inference and Bayesian Statistics.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 14:.  32<br>Besides the courses in my program, I didn’t do exercises in the textbooks for more time to read more. So I have no training except for using the learned knowledge to understand new material, which I thought is more efficient for my purpose of reading and understanding.<br>And I haven’t have a command of manifolds. I am weak at Analysis and Algebraic Geometry. I will learn more Applied Mathematics in a Data Sciencce BSc and get academic grades, such as Numerical Methods, Graph Theory, Simulation Modeling, Game Theory, Operation Research, Statistic Analysis and Theoretical Computer Science.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 14:54<br>There will be some electives depending on the program, which are mostly in Applied Mathematics or Computer Science. I find Quantum Computing&#x2F;Quantum Information is the most advanced elective course. And this could support the PhD research in Graph theory and Quantum Information.<br>So the courses of DS BSc are good for career and could lead to an Applied Mathematics position. If I want to do pure Mathematics PhD I will definitely need a Master in Mathematics. Now I need to know more about Q1. the Quantum Information, Q2. Industrial PhD and Q3. the requirements of Master, since I might do research in Graph theory in theoretical Computer Science with less requirements in Algebra and I could be certain I would only do Master after having a job.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 15:17</p>
<ol>
<li>For Quantum Information, I like Quantum mechanism as a door of the future but the interest is not strong enough to devote in its research. So it attracts me for the “Graph theory”, “Information” and the last, its own fanciness.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-09 15:24<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/59370/items/1.0040942#:~:text=Discrete%20quantum%20walks%20are%20defined%20on%20graphs.%20Graph,are%20related%20to%20classical%20problems%20in%20graph%20theory">https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/59370/items/1.0040942#:~:text=Discrete%20quantum%20walks%20are%20defined%20on%20graphs.%20Graph,are%20related%20to%20classical%20problems%20in%20graph%20theory</a>.<br>So Graph theory in Quantum information isn’t a recent topic and I just knew about it.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 15:28<br>So in fact Quantum Computing is theoretical Computer Science + Algorithms + Quantum mechanism. For me, this is better than theoretical Physics and Probability theory and Statistics, while it seems less about Graph theory itself. So I will view it as a choice similiar to Brain Science + Graph theory as a STEM PhD, only consider it if it doesn’t need a Master.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 16:40<br>2. In fact, this is again the wish to do Math while earn more money. And “industrial PhD” will definitely be more in Applied Mathematics, unless some research institutes or labs but this comes back to 1. While viewing reddit, I found this kind of question always leads to Quant and now I know there are lots of people in the same ship.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 16:44<br>3. So as a result, maybe I will look for PhD positions in US without Master degree. And I will always be a Math amateur. I really need a real university to know about the research environment and PhD in Mathematics in person.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 18:08<br>Last but not least reason for Mathematics PhD is that I like to be around with Math mind people or at least the people loving theories, and I know with the highest likelihood I will find the right person related to pure Mathematics. Obviously, a Math mind person will find like-minded people in a Mathematics community. </p>
<p>2024-05-09 19:19<br>Also, I very enjoy being around with talented and motivated people. Back when I was in a Mathematics Olympics program, I met the most intellegent and awesome classmates I had ever saw and had a good time with lots of friends, talking about Math puzzles, new tricks and books and daily small talks. I never felt bored with all the chanllenges, since we had the work load as twice as the normal students. But the most important thing is we can always have new knowledge to learn and puzzles to think of, this made the load worthwhile and everyone was happy and excited everyday. The 1st of us could even tell interesting jokes with Physics, which I still remember today. </p>
<p>2024-05-09 19:39<br>On the flip side, the program is selective, competitive with the over study load and unmatched possible outcome. So I had the most stressful time in the selecting period, especially after I realized half of the students had prepared ahead while I was totally new to all the courses. However, I gradually caught up, though with less sleep and a very intensive timetable. But if there is a similiar program I will choose without any hesitation, because in the end I really learned a lot from all the excellent top students.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 19:52<br>So in fact there is a similiar question in reddit: “r&#x2F;sysor Operations Research PhD?”. Well, its title doesn’t include Graph theory, neither does mine.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 20:00<br>So some notes are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many OR problems involve Graphs and OR is diverse.</li>
<li>OR could be under different departments, such as Economics and Management in Bussiness school, Mathematics and Computer Science.</li>
<li>So one can choose research topics with a lot of freedom as a Professor, while a PhD is still a academic program.</li>
<li>Finding a PhD advisor is important.</li>
<li>Most OR&#x2F;IE PhD programs do faculty-oriented admissions and therefore finding an advisor whose work one is interested in is important, since one will work with the advisor.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-09 20:13<br>So now I finally know choosing a PhD is more about choosing a faculty and a Professor. There are some professors recommanded in a reddit Q&amp;A five years ago (r&#x2F;math “Where to learn about spectral graph theory”)</p>
<ol>
<li>Dr. Fan Chung<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chung/">https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chung/</a></li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-09 20:32<br>Wow, very excellent and genius Mathematician paragon before the Age of Information. _1. So Graph theory found its applied counterpart in Internet and therefore had a emergence. Since Graph is a very general object, I think the emergence occurred with Internet and Bell Communications Research is due to the fact that these are the first complicated and man made networks, other than the soical networks which are not easy to conduct research and the Biological networks which need advanced tools.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 20:54<br>_2. A brief overview of Dr. Fan Chung’s career path, Mathematics BSc-&gt; M.S. and PhD at the University of Pennsylvania-&gt;a job as a member of Technical Staff working for the Mathematical Foundations of Computing Department at Bell Laboratories-&gt; Division Manager of Mathematics, Informations Sciences and Operations Research at Bellcore in 1986-&gt;1989 visiting professor at Princeton marked the beginning of a new association with the academic world-&gt;back to academic world<br>_3. Another legendary with Erdos.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 20:56<br>2. prof.dr.ir Willem Haemers (emeritus)</p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:14<br>_1. Publications of Willem Haemers are mostly theoretical and focused on the spectral Graph theory, while he woked in the Department of Econometrics and Operation Research in the Tilburg School of Economics and Management. So he should conducted the Graph theory courses, but there is no information of his career. _2. His early publications in 1980s were related to Traffic Engineering in Communication Networks and Telecommunications Services. So Networks are in the basic topics of a Graph theory researcher.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:27<br>3. Vladimir Nikiforov<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://umwa.memphis.edu/fcv/viewcv.php?personUUID=vnikifrv">https://umwa.memphis.edu/fcv/viewcv.php?personUUID=vnikifrv</a><br>He got MS in Mathematics and Computer Science in 1978 and PhD in Computer Science in 2004, then became a professor in “Math Science” in 2012. So this is a more normal example of academic career path. And although he didn’t get degrees in pure Mathematics, his publications are still in Grapg theory. This gives me some comfort.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:32<br>4. Professor Steve Kirkland<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://server.math.umanitoba.ca/%7Ekirkland/">https://server.math.umanitoba.ca/%7Ekirkland/</a><br>A younger Professor with publications in Quantum Computing.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:42<br>5. Professor Paul Horn<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cs.du.edu/~paulhorn/">https://cs.du.edu/~paulhorn/</a></p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:44<br>6. Professor Daniel A. Spielman<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/">https://cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/</a><br>So the research topics are changing as the evolving of science and technlogy, especially in Applied Mathematics.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:47<br>7. Dr. Steve Butler</p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:50<br>So now I know I should start with Dr. Fan Chung’s publications and gain more insights in Graph theory and the Ramsy theory. Then I think I should know the next step. Also, I will learn more about Networks during the BSc in Data Science.</p>

        <p>2024-05-08 22:08<br>It is said being a professor after a Mathematics PhD is very hard and it seems the only benefit of doing a Math PhD, especially in pure Mathematics, is having the freedom and the full-time to devote into the interested Mathematics field or Math puzzle. However, this is a very ideal thought without any budget in time or earning, even without the possibility of the difficulties in the chosen topic. And as what I have searched today, this might be not practical since there will be a supervisor. </p>
<p>2024-05-08 22:22<br>So the key point is the theoretical and complicated nature of Mathematics puzzles. I was inspired by Erdos and Penrose in 2020 and their stories along with many other long lasting Math puzzles’ stories made me realize solving Mathematical puzzles are more like a lifelong hobby, since it doesn’t like practical problems with clear deadline and timeliness which therefore always have a ending.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 22:30<br>So in 2020 I chose to keep Mathematics as a lifelong hobby. Apparantly I was too young to understand the meaning of “lifelong”. In year1 I just wanted to read Mathematics I liked as much as I could, because at which time I found the CSE major has too limited contents in Mathematics. There was not a program courses overview before getting into the campus. So I was too focused on sparing time and reading to find whether there were other choices until 202404.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 22:38<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/44244/what-recent-discoveries-have-amateur-mathematicians-made/">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/44244/what-recent-discoveries-have-amateur-mathematicians-made/</a><br>Now I finally searched about Mathematics again and I found the examples of Math amateurs with discoveries are not really not “amateur”. </p>
<p>2024-05-08 22:42<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gregegan.net/">https://www.gregegan.net/</a><br>Greg Egan is definitely in the community of science and Mathematics.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 22:44<br>So now I finally realized the key point is to engaging in the Math community, keep reading and trying and having the basics in Mathematics. (In a JD way, having BSc&#x2F;MSc level of Mathematics or STEM.) Last but not least, the culture and environment are also important. I always think doing pure Math is in fact or should be a leisure process with no timeline and a math&#x2F;science community&#x2F;locally or online culture could make one keeps in the context with new feeds or inspiration.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 22:54<br>Unfortunately these are all what I don’t have currently, so I will settle down first.</p>

        <p>2024-05-08 19:50<br>Searching about PhD in Combinatorics brought me to Operation Reasearch and Heuristic Optimization which are all out of the scope of the pure Math I want. OR is more about Economics, Data Science and Decision making, while the heuristic Algorithms only attracted me in 2021 by its name until I knew it’s poor in theory and I thought it’s a paradigm in nonlinear optimization of the nature of Computer Science as a compromise for application from Mathmatics to reality.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 20:10<br>So I changed to the field attracted me most, the Graph theory, especially the Ramsey theory and the legendary Erdos. I know chosing a university for PhD depends more on the professors and the department, so I want to know which universities are good for PhD in Graph theory.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 20:18<br>Since Graph is a very common and powerful object, it has different instance in different context or fields. </p>
<p>2024-05-08 20:32<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/146407/what-a-shame-versus-such-a-shame">https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/146407/what-a-shame-versus-such-a-shame</a><br>(I want to use the meaning of “shame” in “What a shame.” but “Im ashamed” seems with stronger feeling than I want to express. Because I have to say I haven’t read Math books since 202206 and only recall some topics while searching and viewing reddit.)<br>Some examples of Graph in different context:</p>
<ol>
<li>Graphs in Computer Science, which I think of is applying graphs by its nature as models of the individuals and its relationship and then conducting Algorithms.</li>
<li>Networks, which I thought while reading, is more practical with clear restrictions in the form of the graphs. As a result, in my opinion, Networks became a object on its own with few properties of general graphs. So I think Networks, such as in EE, NN, Internet and Biological Networks.</li>
<li>Probabilistic Graphical Model, which I thought was mainly a type of probabilistic model using graphs. So I didn’t continute to read when I found its textbooks are in fact of Probability theory and Statistics, other than the Graph theory itself I was looking for.</li>
<li>Dynamic Networks, which I thought was interesting for the dynamic property but by its nature a practical model in Applied Mathematics.</li>
<li>Knowledge Graph, Social Networks, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-08 21:03<br>So above are the applications of Graphs(2-5) or Graph theory(part of 1). Well, I once wondered whether Graph theory could be very abstract since its main functions are to simplify and model the objects and the relationship. However, there are still many clearly pure Mathematics topics with Graphs:<br>6. Graph Algorithms, while Computer Science itself is a branch of Applied Mathematics.<br>7. Algebraic Graph theory, which I just knew about today and indeed attracted me.<br>8. Graph Coloring, which I read in 2020 and inspired me that many interesting Mathematics puzzles come from leisure puzzles like coloring which includes 4-Color theorem and Ramsey theory and tessellation such as Penrose Tilings. Again I just recalled while writing, I only found the topic in 202205 but hadn’t read.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 21:37<br>9. Random Graph, Erdos is really the king of probabilitic methods and The Book really amazed me in 2020.<br>10. Ramsey theory, which is a paradigm of how a simple Math puzzle grew into a huge and complicated research field.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2017/REUPapers/Tesliuc.pdf">https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2017/REUPapers/Tesliuc.pdf</a></p>
<p>2024-05-09 07:45<br>11. Extremal Graph theory, interesting with Combinatorics and counting theory.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 21:44<br>I have to say I temporarily forgot much about these until I have a chance to learn more about Mathematics. So if I choose to do PhD, I will choose theoretical Graph theory. Now I want to know how to choose a good university. In fact, I always think engaging in solving Math puzzles is not exclusive, at least compared to other Science subjects. However, I haven’t read about any recnet discovery of amateurs.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 21:55<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/44244/what-recent-discoveries-have-amateur-mathematicians-made/">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/44244/what-recent-discoveries-have-amateur-mathematicians-made/</a><br>So the reason is I haven’t searched about this before. And the deeper reason is I haven’t joined the community, even not engaged in Mathoverflow.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 22:04<br>Now for choosing universities good at theoretical Graph theory. Well, I know it is said that PhD in Statistics is hot due to the rise of Machine Learning and there are lots of Stat PhD, while I haven’t seen a PhD titled with Graph theory.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 07:51<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/gras/2023/RS0101">https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/gras/2023/RS0101</a><br>It is said shanghai ranking is based on academic measure, but it only has “Mathematics” in “Natural Sciences”, obviously too cursory with mainly Applied Mathematics.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 08:04<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/133001/graduate-schools-for-graph-theory">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/133001/graduate-schools-for-graph-theory</a><br>So there is actually a question about this, but it is not current. By the way, during my searching yesterday I found:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many US universities have ACO program (Algorithms, COmbinatorics and Optimization)<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.urch.com/forums/topic/109178-admission-aco-cmu-vs-gatech/">https://www.urch.com/forums/topic/109178-admission-aco-cmu-vs-gatech/</a><br>A not current disscusion.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-09 08:33<br>A recommendation list from Mathoverflow in 2015-01-23.<br>“General: Rutgers, UCSD, Tel Aviv, Waterloo, McGill, Princeton, Yale, Eötvös Loránd University, Rényi Institute, Emory University, Queen Mary University of London, Warwick University, Simon Frasier University, Charles University in Prague, University of Hamburg.<br>Algebraic Graph Theory: Waterloo, University of Western Australia, Tilburg University, CWI Amsterdam, QMUL, Imperial College London, Tohoku University, Delaware, Clemson, Michigan Technological University, Wyoming.”</p>
<p>2024-05-09 08:35<br>So it seems that US has more research in Graph theory than EU.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 10:33<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://scholarshipdb.net/graph-theory-scholarships/Program-PhD">https://scholarshipdb.net/graph-theory-scholarships/Program-PhD</a><br>So applying for PhD is the same as applying for a job. And some require BSc and MSc in Mathematics, which wil narrow the choices of BSc.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 11:58<br>I saw someone said there are also industrial PhD but I haven’t searched about it.</p>

        <p>2024-05-08 15:58<br>During the the interaction and trade-offs between ideal and reality and all kinds of changes including environment, age, knowledge, role and phase, memories could be block-wise divided by time, or the transition point. Then usually one will be in a current mind that focus on the present and the furture, only remember something when cncounter some reminder. And sometimes one may in a nostalgia mood focusing mainly on the past. However, time never still, the “current” turns into memories in the timeline. This is brain’s magic, the ability to “travel” the time in a mental sense.</p>

        <p>2024-05-07 22:53<br>Having a person to tell every room to not forget to turn off the light every day is really the most weird thing I have ever seen.</p>
<p>2024-05-07 22:56<br>Today I knew more about the current IT job market and pure Math PhD.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 07:08<br>So it is widely said 1. there is now a global layoff in IT, companies leaves the most experienced and skilled Seniors and reduce the budget by layoff and using cheaper Juniors, 2. there are too many devs diversed in quality, 3. IT workers are at the first of the layoff risk.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 07:30<br>These information made me wonder how the job market will be after my graduation, but there is still 3-4 years so it is not certain. And the reasons I chose CS was 1. it is&#x2F;could be related to Mathematics, at least in Discrete, Algorithm and Statistics and 2. is was considered promising in employment and salary as a tech job. But now I have no Mathematics in curriculum of CSE and the advantage in job market seems gone.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 07:39<br>In fact, my first choice in major was AI for the preference for Mathematics and Brain Science with some CS skills. This was the reason I read Machine Learning books and joined in Kaggle in the first semaster. So now Data Science might offer more job opportunities, since it’s mixed with Applied Mathematics&#x2F;Machine Learning, Data Analysis and Software Engineering.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 07:54<br>So DS is better choice for me for the more courses in at least Applied Mathematics and the skills which can support my curiosity in Quant. I like geeks and hacks, but I am more attracted by Math, information and data. So I will change the program for a better support for practicing and enhancing my skills in DS.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 08:04<br>Also, I am attracted by doing pure Math, especially in Combinatorics, Graphs, Number theoory and Abstract Algebra.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 08:28<br>Since doing PhD is a career choice, it involves lots of factors. And my interested areas seem all not easy and have fewer connection with industry. I knew my practical choice was to take a DS job and keep pure Math as hobby, just being evoked by my friend’s post of doing Math who went into the top university and at the oppoturnity of changing program.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 08:28<br>While I have no access to research, even have to pay a lot for transportation, this Hons College really took me into nowhere, except made me knewn about HC and realized my former thought “An isolated campus should be a more quiet place for reading and learning” was wrong.</p>

        <p>2024-05-07 13:33<br>Viewing a following’s post about his first proof published years ago, I had to get out of the room because the room recently was used for middle school students who paid a pot of money to get into the university’s program of airline company. Then I had to try to avoid passive smoking during the corridor and find an unaffected room which is facing a road with hish speed wheeling. Because there are only several  rooms in three sections.</p>
<p>2024-05-07 13:58<br>In fact I had read the post just before my first semaster, at which time I had no better choice of university and had to make most of the summer vocation to read Mathematics when the time hadn’t been occupied by other things. Then obviously I forgot about the post since it had no use to me, though with all the noise and suffering I couldn’t really forget and I will never forget about my heart. Now I know forgetting is sometimes a self-protection of brain and sometimes is due to practical reasons since memory is originally used for living and important things. </p>
<p>2024-05-07 14:14<br>And now I have gradually been fully familiar with preparing for the disturbence since these are daily suffering.</p>

        <p>2024-05-07 08:19<br>I want to make a backup of some mainly used websites by scraping. There are several types of websites classified by data types, such as text, videos and musics. I found some tools but some only server as downloader. I want to download as much information as possible other than only the main content.</p>
<p>2024-05-07 08:50<br>And most of the scrapy tools need MySQL.</p>
<p>2024-05-07 09:45<br>So I need to learn about Oauth and how to access the private Git server, since a useful tool was moved to the auther’s server.</p>
<p>2024-05-07 10:21<br>So above is the Question1&#x2F;Q1, accessibility. And Q2 is again the problem of ip being banned after some time. Since these data can last for a long time, I could download slowly in maybe one year. Also, Q3 is that the avaliable tools are always lack of some specific data, which needs additional scrapping. So the key point is the accessibility of data.</p>
<p>2024-05-07 15:14<br>Since writing and testing code cost additional time and personal data collecting often only need to scrap once, I choose to use screenshots to save the data. Another reason is all the target data is in Android platform for in the period I didn’t have a PC.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 08:24<br>So some places use teaching building to fulfill social function and serve as park of local employees.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 13:21<br>So some websites do not provide API and banned the users’ scraping tool in github, left only few private code which needs modification and reconstruction.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 13:37<br>So the main difficulty is in login Auth with cookie.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 15:39<br>I have to say, using Android screenshots to back app data is inefficient and only feasible for up to 200-300 posts&#x2F;pages. The only advantage of this is without any cost or requirements in techniques and remembering while viewing. </p>
<p>2024-05-08 15:48<br>Weird, there are rumbling outside the windows far away somewhere.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 15:52<br>Since I only backup my personal data of around 2000 posts and I find it useful to review the Q&amp;A I marked before, I will use SingleFile to download all the posts after unfolding with a doable amount load.</p>

<p>2024-05-06 10:32<br>As for the belongings, I have three big boxes, two of which with weight above 1kg. Also I have a box with little weight and three small boxes. The total weight are around 10kg I guess and will lager than 2mx2mx2m.</p>

        <p>2024-05-06 08:10<br>Making a To-Do list or checklist ahead is useful especially when preparing for things after months. By the way, Twilight is definitely the paragon of making checklist.<br>Since from the summer holiday I will begin my cycling and streetview making routine, I made a To-Do list for the procedure of the applicaion and preparation. Basically after the admission there are just transfer, certifications, housing, passport and tickets which are evenly distributed in every month. And only the certifications and passport need some legwork in person, so I put all the legwork in the same day. This needs some scheduling because some legwork is at the end of the procedure while some is at the beginning. Besides legwork, the rest are all via Internet with more flexible schedule in every month.</p>
