        <p>2024-05-16 09:00<br>I need a backbag with following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>enough space around 45x30x15&#x2F;16-20L</li>
<li>could protect the devices in the rain</li>
<li>safety&#x2F;hard to be stolen while travelling<br>For the first time I saw there could be locks in a backbag, which could be helpful.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-16 09:03<br>So there are “Water Repellent”, “Water Resistant” and “Waterproof”, which is kinda confusing.</p>
<p>2024-05-16 09:20<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://foxtrail.fjallraven.com/articles/waterproof-vs-water-repellent-vs-water-resistant">https://foxtrail.fjallraven.com/articles/waterproof-vs-water-repellent-vs-water-resistant</a><br>So “Water Resistant” is not enough for heavy rain, “Water Repellent” is appropriate and “Waterproof” is the strongest.</p>
<p>2024-05-16 09:54<br>So it seems that Dnobo has the best waterproof, while it doesn’t have card bags like XD Design.</p>
<p>2024-05-16 10:30<br>I will choose Dnobo 40L with the largest volume and waterproof.</p>

        <p>2024-05-15 16:39<br>While reading about language barrier and language protection, I think it is not fully reasonable to reduce the usage of other languages for the sake of protecting native language. From my observations, language itself keeps evolving all the time, especially in the Internet or in a local domain&#x2F;context&#x2F;group so for language protection there much more aspects than the usage of other languages. During the evolution of society and Internet environment, language is being added new words or new meanings of to the original words, which all to some degree bring some change to the language, in both good and bad aspects.</p>
<p>2024-05-15 16:39<br>Moreover, I think refusing other languages is just like trying to reduce the change to brains. However, both language and especially the brain are dynamic. Every day one receives tons of information which will be selected, analysed and memorized by the brain. So changes are not preventable. But there are always steady states which we can hold on to. And this is what I think the protection or the solution for dynamic changes.</p>
<p>2024-05-15 18:20<br>Now I finally had finished my intensive information searching and got a basic plan for the coming years.</p>

        <p>2024-05-12 12:43<br>In my opinion, “being normal” is only used properly when compared to the extreme cases. And other times, it is noly due to one’s lack of knowledge or tolerence. Since we could never detailly define what is being normal, due to the diversity of human being. We could only use extreme cases or improper cases to explain its meaning. From my experience, I had been insisted by my mother to go to the hospital to meet clinical psychologists, twice, with one in the local hospital doing dumm questioins and resulting in I was no problem while my mother was anxious, the other driving to the capital city’s top hospital in mental health and psychopathology, doing 300 dumm even some translated-by-machine questions again and resulted in the specialist said, “It is only my personal traits.”</p>
<p>2024-05-12 13:04<br>So sometimes people may confused being normal with homogenization, which I think is a very horrible phenomenon. Only with diversity, the social and culture could develop and evolve to higher level. Also, only with tolerence and sometimes protection, the “looks not normal” individual may freely discover his&#x2F;her expertise and even sometimes bring genius to the society.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>2024-05-11 21:15<br>Since the information about the current job market is much more than I thought, it needs a seperate post.<br>Well, I am a Math&#x2F;IT student with few knowledge about Economics. So I just search in reddit to get some real example and maybe some insight. Since I am only in my early 20s, my observation of the job market is all in 2015-2021. Based on my poor knowledge, I guess some new technology akin to Ai will improve the situation. While what I can be sure about is there indeed won’t be any critical achievements in the bottleneck fields which could bring a evolution in the near future and AI’s development also slowed down due to the theoretical and hardware restrictions.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 21:29<br>Well, one thing I am confused about is, I haven’t saw any influence in daily life or purchasing, this is why I didn’t know about the recession except for viewing the job market. Some information I found:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is recently said the situation will last until the interest rates become lower, which might take 3-5 years.<br>This kinda surprised me, since 3-5 years isn’t a short time.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-11 21:40<br>2. Some one blamed at the sharehoulders, which is a new word for me. But his was criticized by another person saying “Inflation is caused by government, interests rates are raised to control the money in circulation. Sometimes layoff is necessary for company’s productive and it’s a much more complex issue.” The later is more reasonable, but I am more confused about the complexity mentioned. If it is periodic then it should be able to forecast to some degree.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 06:56<br>Another usual desk-moving in the weekend’s morning.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 18:28<br>Now I am really good at holding my breath to prevent all the smells and passvive smoking.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 22:54<br>3. After viewing, I think hospital and health data is okay for me.</p>
<p>2024-05-13 08:44<br>4. Lots of people said SDE is primarily relpaced by AI since now 3 person + AI could do the work needed 4 person in the past and AI is good at reducing the dubug work.</p>
<p>2024-05-14 08:50<br>5. So it is said the baseline of Quant is Applied Math+programming skills. And I just realized I will only be motivated when there are Math courses.</p>
<p>2024-05-14 12:35<br>6. It is said Quant now are used wider than before and the market is growing repidly. And boutique firms(another new word) are great while banking&#x2F;asset finance is easier to land to start. So now I will know more about the specific Mathematics and Data Science techniques used in Quant and do some projects to know the job in person, well, after finishing all the preparations.</p>
<p>2024-05-15 07:33<br>Another moving-around morning, came at 6:50 followed by the cleaning-air old women and her womon friend coming every room, walking through, checking the lights and talking and laughing about “the job” with the old woman. Well, so many people in reddit like to make sarcasm of AI, they really should feel lucky to have Ai, compared with some places having no AI affected with all the ridiculous jobs.</p>
<p>2024-05-15 07:54<br>So basically, job is one entity gives another some tasks with some compensation. Some jobs are competitive and deserve the efforts. Well, jobs are very diverse and realistic, so I think little things could be certain until I actually begin job hunting.</p>
<p>2024-05-15 08:02<br>7. I always wonder whether Quant belongs to IT or finance sector. A post said there are tech-driven and finance-driven Quant, whih different cultures and details. Also, it is said Quant is highly competitive and mostly concentrated in financial centers like NYC and London, while DS is broader. And they have lots of overlaps.</p>
<p>2024-05-15 13:15<br>Another trolly-wheeling noon, usually followed by an old woman breaking in and cleaning the air again.</p>
<p>2024-05-15 13:17<br>8. Some post said for a Quant job a prestigious university’ degree is a major factor, some said much Quant jobs don’t need a Master if one has enough skill set. Well, I think skills and experience are more useful in jobs. But how can one get experience working in famous companies if being not pass the resume screen.</p>
<p>2024-05-15 13:49<br>I have to say a huge part of the lesson I have learned is suffering changes endurance gradually.</p>
<p>2024-05-15 14:04<br>9. So a useful advice is that to do a Master if having troubles in landing a job. I think this is the difference between students&#x2F;undergrads with ones already had jobs. So again the specific choices in career path could be complicated due to multiple goals and trade-offs.</p>
<p>2024-05-16 12:09<br>Well, one more question is that whether there is some rigor bar like only PhD acceptable for Quant research, since the salary of PhD is similiar to the junior combining all the compensation and costs. Then if PhD could skip the Junior stage then it could be a better choice.</p>
<p>2024-05-16 12:24<br>I found some discussions about PhD and Quant in 2024-2016, which made me wonder how this market has evolved. It is said PhD gives one enough time and training for reading publications and Mathematics techniques, also it gives one enough time to learn about the market and the integration, which are all from the aspect of landing a job. However, like most said, PhD is not necessary for a Quant, since these are all skills not necessarily relevant to doing a PhD. PhD is itself a career choice, so I don’t agree with someone said PhD is a tool or process compared with MFE.</p>
<p>2024-05-16 14:46<br>Someone said in DS, some higher or the highest positions in US companies require PhD, one answer used an argument in the “Millionaire Next Door” by Thomas Stanley that if maximizing earning potential is the goal, getting a PhD is not recommended. And one gave more detail in PhD choices, that a PhD focusing in an area that has high demand and low supply is likely to be lucrative. Well, I think this will restrict the PhD choice to “the goal of maximizing earning potential”. It’s ture this could be a trade-off combining doing research to get PhD and maximizing earning, since this is like doing research for industry. So if a MS can get into R&amp;D then these two paths are similiar.</p>
<p>2024-05-16 15:30<br>Out of curiosity, I searched about Quantum Computer’s potential. It is said Quantum computing has hardly even proved any commercial viability and is still purely experimental. Also, it is said Quantum computing will not replace the conventional computing for traditional tasks, only useful for a few specific types of tasks that simply cannot be done within a reasonable amount of time on conventional computers. So I think before my retirement there might not be something like personal Quantum computer, whereas AI is more likely to bring new improvements with the techniques of Data Science. Thinking about how things had changed in the 50 years, well, half is a confusing measure, sometimes it’s a lot while sometimes it has a lot left. Anyway, now Im sure I will not encourter Quantum in my job,,</p>

        <p>2024-05-12 12:05<br>Jerk couple talk and laugh through the corridor, of which the male sings or whisltes whenever walking in the corridor, making the educational building and classroom their hotel. This is certain to happen given the fact of the campus only has six majors without even a derpartment, only the ones without thoughts or without choices would come with the annual cost equal the foreign universities.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 12:12<br>In fact, I don’t like this anime. In 2021, I was lack of good anime and find it in the related animes of Cowboy Bebop.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 12:19<br>I picked GunxSword out of two reasons: 1. it has the same Executive Producer as Code Geass, who prevented Yiqilou Ohkouchi from making C.C and Charles to kiss, 2. its main character Van looks like Spike and shares some similiarities.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 12:25<br>But it turned out GunxSword is shallow and lack of thoughts, the only main theme I found was about the revange of the Claw without other things. A Notice is, I think this anime cannot be given to children. Because some plots are void and pointless, also a bad charater from which I couldn’t find any good thing and in fact I skipped some plots.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 12:33<br>Few things deserves mention are: 1. There is an okay character, a purely kindness girl but only a few plots. 2. The couple and the old heroes are good people with okay plots. 3. The only situation this anime can be suit for, I think, is related to personal loss and sorrow. Otherwise, this anime will disturb the mood. 4. Its OST is unique.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 12:54<br>And the old women like to talk outside the door. </p>
<p>2024-05-13 07:49<br>I changed to another room to find so everyone here is a singer especially when walking in the corridor.</p>
<p>2024-05-14 12:09<br>What a horrible place, with stuffs caring nothing than bringing their children to meals and all the smells passive smoking along the roads.</p>

        <p>2024-05-10 13:54<br>Recently I have regular left upper quadrant pain before and after meals only while walking. I had searched about to find fasting could related to it with pancreas problems. I knew about fasting in 2020 and I began fasting in 2021. Now I have a regular meal routine, two meals one is around 10:50 and another is around 16:50. From 202109-202206 I have a regular meal around 6:50 and then random one or two meals or none. My left upper quadrant pain for the first time occurred in 202204 usually in the afternoon, at which time I only had nuts besides meals.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 19:34<br>Now the pain occurs after meals and drinking water.</p>

        <p>2024-05-10 12:30<br>Since now I finally know about Department, Faculty and Professors, I want to use this knowledge to improve my choice of university. I want to figure out Q1: How does the Department and Faculty affect the degree programs? From the searching examples and my experience, a Professor’s research usually has nothing to do with the Professor’s degree courses. So I want to know whether there is no need to check about the Faculty if not doing research. Q2: I still didn’t find any rank of universities in specific Mathematics field. I am curious about Huangary’s reputation in Combinatorics and I wonder whether its universities are better in Combinatorics. </p>
<p>2024-05-10 14:16<br>Q3: I want to know more about the job market for Data Science&#x2F;Applied Mathematics. Since it is said there are global layoffs in IT&#x2F;tech, which makes the CSE&#x2F;SWE less lucrative. </p>
<p>2024-05-10 15:30<br>It is said in reddit when choosing a PhD the priorities are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The advisor</li>
<li>The reputation of department and school in the field</li>
<li>The location<br>But this brings the question back to how to know about the reputation of department and school in a specific field.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-10 15:34<br>Well, out of curiosity, I searched about universities’ Mathematics department though.</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ru.nl/en/departments/institute-for-mathematics-astrophysics-and-particle-physics/mathematics">https://www.ru.nl/en/departments/institute-for-mathematics-astrophysics-and-particle-physics/mathematics</a><br>Radboud University has the most pure Mathematics research in NL and it is the unique one combining Mathematics with Physics. However, it doesn’t focus on Graph theory nor Computer Science.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-10 21:32<br>In fact, Radboud University has the most Mathematics research in total, which I think also explains why its Data Science BSc has lots of academic writing.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 21:43<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ru.nl/en/institute-for-computing-and-information-sciences/research">https://www.ru.nl/en/institute-for-computing-and-information-sciences/research</a><br>So Radboud University set Data Science under the iCIS which has research focus on Software Science, Digital Security and Data Science.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 21:46<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://das.cs.ru.nl/Projects">https://das.cs.ru.nl/Projects</a><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v216/claassen23a.html">https://proceedings.mlr.press/v216/claassen23a.html</a><br>Their Data Science research focuses on applications of Data Science and the development of AI. I only find one publication about Graph theory which are part of improving the Algorithm.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 21:54<br>2. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics">https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics</a><br>It is said Leiden is strong in Mathematics, while its topics are less than Radbound. So Leiden has a unique Algebra, Geometry and Number Theory program.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 22:20<br>3. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/discrete-mathematics/publications/">https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/discrete-mathematics/publications/</a><br>   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/algebraic-combinatorics/persons/">https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/algebraic-combinatorics/persons/</a><br>So TU&#x2F;e has a Discete Mathematics research group focuses on data structure and algorithms and a smaller Algebraic Combinatorics group.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 22:30<br>4. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://qutech.nl/">https://qutech.nl/</a><br>   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/qutech">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/qutech</a><br>I didn’t find a Mathematics department in TUD, but they have a unique QuTech Institute.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 22:33<br>5. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/">https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/</a><br>RUG has a Bernoulli Institute but I didn’t find Group theory.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 22:48<br>For Q1, so the connection with the department and faculty is diverse. For a BSc student not doing research, the corriculum and the structure of the program are more important.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 06:38<br>Since PhD in EU normally requieres a Master degree, this comes back to the question of courses requirements, which can be modeled by a three-layer graph. So what really matters for the BSc’s study is corriculum. And knowing about knowledge involved in some research topics will be helpful.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 07:17<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/applied-mathematics/discrete-mathematics-optimization">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/applied-mathematics/discrete-mathematics-optimization</a><br>So there is an Applied Mathematics department in TUD and they do extremal combinatorics.<br>And I just find fingerprint is very useful for konwing about which topics are focused.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 07:27<br>Some publications in Graph theroy of TUD:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/the-ccap-for-graph-products-of-operator-algebras">https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/the-ccap-for-graph-products-of-operator-algebras</a><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/co-eigenvector-graphs">https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/co-eigenvector-graphs</a><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/complementarity-and-similarity-in-complex-networks">https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/complementarity-and-similarity-in-complex-networks</a><br>So I think a researcher in Graph theory usually has Spectral Graph theory in the theory side and Networks in the application side. I will like the topics in Spectral Graph theory with graphs and matrices.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 07:27<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://asp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13634-022-00960-6">https://asp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13634-022-00960-6</a><br>I haven’t read about Signal Processing nor Graph Time-series. So the motivation of the Applied aspect in Graph theory is to understand the underlying structure of the complex network and the evolution of Graph models which has some intersection with Ramsey theory.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 08:04<br>6. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/mathematics-centre-maastricht-mcm">https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/mathematics-centre-maastricht-mcm</a><br>As a reputational university well-known for Business and Economics. UM has fewer Technology research, its Mathematics centre is composed with Advanced Computer Sciences and Quantitative Economics.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 08:28<br>So UM only has research in Applied Mathematics focused on Operation Research, Game theory and Theoretical Computer Science.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 08:40<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/search/graph?type=edismax&cp=collection:20765&islandora_solr_search_navigation=1&f%5B0%5D=-(ancestors_ms:%22collection:20773%22)&f%5B1%5D=ancestors_ms:%22collection:20778%22&f%5B2%5D=RELS_EXT_isMemberOfCollection_uri_ms:%22info%5C:fedora%5C/collection%5C:20809%22">https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/search/graph?type=edismax&amp;cp=collection%3A20765&amp;islandora_solr_search_navigation=1&amp;f%5B0%5D=-%28ancestors_ms%3A%22collection%3A20773%22%29&amp;f%5B1%5D=ancestors_ms%3A%22collection%3A20778%22&amp;f%5B2%5D=RELS_EXT_isMemberOfCollection_uri_ms%3A%22info%5C%3Afedora%5C/collection%5C%3A20809%22</a><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/68041?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=6f7bdb3a646d51eaee7a&solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=1">https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/68041?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=6f7bdb3a646d51eaee7a&amp;solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&amp;solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=1</a><br>So Leiden also has a Advanced Computer Science institute and it seems Leiden has the most publications in Graph theory.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 15:40<br>Some many wierd things, old women come into rooms daily to clean the air, young men come into the rooms weekly to “check and maintain” the never-used computer of the self-studying classroom. So they use the educational buildings to generate jobs and obviously layoff won’t be a problem here since all the managers are sitting in their each half-classroom large office in the six floor of another building never coming in the building.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 15:08<br>I actually just realized in a university I could go to lectures of topics I am interseted in. Guess Im too used to self-learning, since before and in a College there are only courses and exams as all the academic activities.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 11:44<br>So devoting in pure Mathematics will need 5 years to get into PhD position and to have the possibility to freely do research after 3 more years with no earning, while doing internship to start career after BSc is much more lucrative and prudent.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 11:56<br>In fact, in 2020 I thought the type of engagement of Mathematics I want is like Ramanujan or Erdos. Because I began the study and training of Mathematics Olympics late and hasty, from knowing nothing to being able to solve some questions and soomthly read textbooks within six months. I don’t have surprising genius, even nor able to catch up with the peers which mostly started learning MO as a kid with better surroundings. So I knew I just one of the Mathematics amateurs with love, learning, being inspired and trying to solve some puzzles.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 12:17<br>Another thought is, in my opinion, Mathematics gives one the most freedom to learn and even create, since doing Mathematics is mostly mental activities there are no limitations of experiments or labs like nature science. </p>
<p>2024-05-11 12:24<br>As for Graph theory, I think and conclude from recent searching that, it is always connected to the Applied aspect, from the beginning and during the evolution. But in theory it has its own compexity and fun. So I think the best starting point for me should be some industrial research related to Graph theory, which could both bring me some career experience and take me into the academic research of Graph theory.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 12:55<br>One thing I am sure about is I will study and live in a environment or community with Math amateurs and Math-minded people.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 13:07<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.stankova.net'/">http://www.stankova.net&#39;/</a><br>A great researcher. I think this should be the most helpful application of Mathematics. It’s pleasant to know about great researchers and be motivated to learn more.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 15:13<br>As for Q2, in reddit some said it’s due to the excellent Professors and then a positive cycle, while some said the relation is weak. Then I found a Hungary teacher’s insights, as there are lots of competitions which they can take part in from 11 years old. Since Combinatorics often doesn’t need Analysis or other university level Mathematics, it becomes the perfect topic for MO competitions. Plus the positive effect of the famous Hungarian Mathematicians, Hungary becomes a place where more people are good at Combinatorics. In conclusion, being good at Mathematics is mostly an outcome of early training and inherent interest, and for choosing educational programs the nationality is not directly related to being prominent.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 15:47<br>Also, one person said Hungary’s language has some advantage, I cannot test it currently.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 16:00<br>Q3 should be a important question. 1. It is said a lot of devs are replaced by automation, which I haven’t noticed since I am still learning the basic SWE. Well, I think this is a certain and natural result, as a new development of automation and part of the cycle of technology. After all, my BSc choice of CS from the beginning is for studying DS.’</p>
<p>2024-05-11 16:14<br>I just realize since the CS&#x2F;devs are over supply, some will not land a job then may go to study MS in DS. So this will make work experience&#x2F;YOE more important.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 19:50<br>I wonder how the job market will be in 3-4 years, but this question couldn’t have certain answer. I think if some new technology rises up, the market will get better. However, VR, which I had heard about in 2016 and focused on its newer name MR, IoT and wearable devices are all not hot enough to stmulate the market like AI did. So I think looking for jobs of other sections might be more helpful, as DS&#x2F;DA is broad in application.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 06:52<br>Weird though, recently I actually began to have some longing for feeling pride of a university, which I even never thought about back in my self-learning days.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 07:11<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/technische-wiskunde/bachelor-of-applied-mathematics/after-your-studies/career-opportunities">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/technische-wiskunde/bachelor-of-applied-mathematics/after-your-studies/career-opportunities</a><br>Well, I just found TUD has career suggestion for Applied Mathematics BSc to start PhD, which is contrary to the normal requirement of a Master. And I just found I haven’t learn about how will a Applied Mathematics BSc graduate’s work look like. Well, it is interesting sometimes when one is motivated, one can just sleep from 01:40 to 05:40 and then jump up not tired at all. </p>
<p>2024-05-12 07:17<br>I want to have earnings in my 30s, also I want to have Math in my life and work. So I initially choose Data Science for the impression that DS&#x2F;CS&#x2F;IT are good for jobs and salary. Well, now the job market are changing and recent motivation from the MO classmates really evokes and pushes me ahead, while in fact back.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 07:37<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/technische-wiskunde/bachelor-of-applied-mathematics">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/technische-wiskunde/bachelor-of-applied-mathematics</a><br>So it is taught in Dutch, while it has “100% material in English”. </p>
<p>2024-05-12 07:46<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/itav/education/dutch-courses/tu-delft-students/prospective-bachelor-students">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/itav/education/dutch-courses/tu-delft-students/prospective-bachelor-students</a><br>So they has a solution for this, while an additional year to only learn Dutch is not optimal.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 07:52<br>So proficient in Dutch on B2 level (or higher) is considered as Advanced knowledge.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 08:20<br>Some information from reddit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Applied Mathematics MSc doesn’t open more opportunities than BSc, which aligns with TUD’s suggestion.</li>
<li>Jobs for Applied Mathematics degree are still DS, Risk Analysis, etc. Also obviously, since these are basically the same. Applied Mathematics might have more in Math, while others are basically featured with domain knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-12 08:20<br>So I was motivated mainly by the courses in Complex and Geometry which I am weak in and the allowance of PhD. While giving a second thought, this two courses are all electives and the other courses are nearly the same as Data Science.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 08:36<br>And I just found this program is to some degree tailored for the dual degree with Physics. So one more answer for Q1, the Department designs and decides the program nearly totally, which will form the program’s purpose and the students’ experience, for example, some programs are tailored for research, some provide practice and some are used to gain finance while selling the title.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 08:50<br>All the desks and talking while walking, they actually can moing desks for two hours. The weekends are poor in quietness, even less the weekdays. At least this taught me a program will be stable so my experience in 2022 and the information from the former years are all timely. Still, I don’t have quiet place to read and had to move around, reality taught me.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 09:22<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/phd/phd-admission">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/phd/phd-admission</a><br>So a Master degree is “must”.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 09:30<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/werken-bij-tu-delft/vacatures/details?jobId=17038&jobTitle=PhD%20Position%20Quantum%20Data%20Management%20%20%20%20%20%20">https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/werken-bij-tu-delft/vacatures/details?jobId=17038&amp;jobTitle=PhD%20Position%20Quantum%20Data%20Management%20%20%20%20%20%20</a><br>So PhD in EU needs a Master and is a job of doing research for the chosed topic with a Junior level salary. Compared to the reserch job in companies, PhD has academic environment, advanced topic and might be a preparation for freely research in the future. From the aspet of earning, PhD is not an optimal choice.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 09:37<br>By the way, I for the first time knew about Quantum era and I wonder when will I see its rise.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 09:41<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tue.nl/en/education/bachelor-college/bachelor-applied-mathematics/after-graduation">https://www.tue.nl/en/education/bachelor-college/bachelor-applied-mathematics/after-graduation</a><br>Career stats from TU&#x2F;e:<br>University: 20%<br>Information technology: 19%<br>Research institution: 10%<br>Continuing studies: 10%<br>Government: 9%<br>Consultancy:5%<br>Telecommunications: 4%<br>Banking sector: 4%<br>Self-employed: 2%<br>Well, I haven’t searched about research institution, the only ones I had saw belong to Universities.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 10:02<br>Now there is someone practicing instrument for the music class’s exam. It’s really a headache of the crowded College campus with jerk singing in the corridor.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 10:09<br>The jerk actually singing and walking around the corridor. This is what people do in a crowded campus selling titles to the students which have less choice and know nothing about there are only courses sometimes online without any opportunities, only a title after mechanical courses and exams.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 12:17<br>I really hate after saving my time as much as I could to find the rooms only have disturbance. </p>
<p>2024-05-12 14:49<br>Comparing some MO classmates which are learning  Mathematics with myself, I find the critical difference is the preference in Computer Science, Cyberpunk culture and Data. I had been keen on Cyberpunk since 2016 and I joinned the Internet group of Bronies in 2014, which made me a Cyber citizen and gradually developed a preference of VR&#x2F;MR future.</p>
<p>2024-05-13 10:16<br>It is said ETHZ and EPFL have best Mathematics Department on par with Oxbridge.</p>

        <p>2024-05-10 08:17<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://memorytreasures.com/blogs/news/story-of-healing">https://memorytreasures.com/blogs/news/story-of-healing</a><br>Well, I opened Quora and just happened to read this story. It got me in the end with the words and its insight.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 08:23<br>This reminds me that in fact, when I was a little kid around 5-6 years old, I sometimes lost my toys and then gradually I told myself the new one is the former’s incarnatioin with a new form. I think this is a common feeling, the dislike of loss and the nostalgia, though the degree varies among people, I appreciate this as a indicator of soft kind mind. As for toys, I only had small stuffed animal toys and made a stuffed animal toy when I was a kid and in a period without friends. Normally and molstly, I like toys of 百獣戦队ガオレンジャー, B-Robo Kabutack, The Gransazers and LEGO, whick really brought me lots of fun before Flash and Android games.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 08:45<br>This makes me wonder how will the Internet affect the childhood. There are huge differences between childhood with and without Internet. Essentially, current digital devices with the softwares facilitate the access of information in Internet. The benefit is there are always information to make decisions upon or know about new things, which could make children know more knowledge than the older generation. While at the same time, the problems of eyesight, poor gesture and the low-quality or even bad information also occur.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 09:10<br>Because Internet is in fact a vitural extension of the society. So there is the need of parents’ engagement and regulation. Nevertheless, the quality of the regulation is also uneven. But this is enough to erase the potential bad effects caused by Internet. Last but not least, I am still curios about the difference in minds between a person born with Internet access and the older generations.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 09:20<br>Well, reading more about Kafka reminds me the thoughts about loneliness. Loneliness and introversion really are catalyst for thinking. I have no talent in Literature and I always write as less as I can. Before writing blogs, I never write a complete sentence in private notes. But the boost in thinking is similiar. I always appreciate the introverts such as researchers and genius Mathematicians. Turing and Nash are all my idols.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 09:36<br>I thought loneliness is just a state, which can due to many social, environmental, cultural and personal reasons. Sometimes one may like to be alone for the thinking, studying or creavating. Sometimes the surroundings are not good, in which situation being engaged will bring not good experience. Since human beings are very diverse and uneven, one certainly cannot be happy with all kinds of environments or cultures. So simply judging someone of being too “alone” is obviously lack of thinking.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 09:44<br>So the problem is being extreme, which usually will bring some attention and regulation. But again, human beings are very diverse and the “normal” is just used for the middle of the spectum. In my opinion, this depends on the personal outcomes. For genius like Turing or Kafka, their work is of great importance so the personal traits is in their freedom as long as it doesn’t affect the society. And for normal persons, maybe one has his&#x2F;her own reasons so again as long as is doesn’t affect the society, it’s one’s freedom which needs patience and respect. </p>
<p>2024-05-10 09:57<br>As for Kafka’s opinion of marriage, I actually thought about it in 2020. I thought the society and the market usually need extroverts and the engagement with society tend to make one more extrovert. But this is not a binary classification, I think it’s better to use “the ability of social engagement” as a standard. A lot of people like to be in a quiet environment which usually need to be alone, but everyone has freedom in the spare time. So as long as one can smoothly engage the necessary social events, there should be no judgement. As for me, I am not a genius but I like quietness. And I also want to find a right person to build a family, so in 2020 I came up with a solution of living together while causing no disturbance. Firstly, living in separate rooms will make sure keeping the private space. Then for the chores, an appointment is needed to set a regular timetable, which will make daily with claer schedule to plan upon. When there is something out of the plan, if is is emergent then this is the necessary disturbance, otherwise I came up with a message propose: sending messages and plan to meet when both have spare time. </p>
<p>2024-05-10 10:20<br>It can be written like this:<br>In the house:<br>  Sepatately in each room<br>  if emergency:<br>    necessary disturbance<br>  else:<br>    if both have spare time and A wants to meet and B wants to meet:<br>      do things together</p>
<p>2024-05-10 10:26<br>Of crouse this is incomplete, if there is a kid then in the early years there are necessary disturbances. And this will gradually become a new schedule or a new routine.</p>
