        <p>2024-05-12 12:43<br>In my opinion, “being normal” is only used properly when compared to the extreme cases. And other times, it is noly due to one’s lack of knowledge or tolerence. Since we could never detailly define what is being normal, due to the diversity of human being. We could only use extreme cases or improper cases to explain its meaning. From my experience, I had been insisted by my mother to go to the hospital to meet clinical psychologists, twice, with one in the local hospital doing dumm questioins and resulting in I was no problem while my mother was anxious, the other driving to the capital city’s top hospital in mental health and psychopathology, doing 300 dumm even some translated-by-machine questions again and resulted in the specialist said, “It is only my personal traits.”</p>
<p>2024-05-12 13:04<br>So sometimes people may confused being normal with homogenization, which I think is a very horrible phenomenon. Only with diversity, the social and culture could develop and evolve to higher level. Also, only with tolerence and sometimes protection, the “looks not normal” individual may freely discover his&#x2F;her expertise and even sometimes bring genius to the society.</p>

        <p>2024-05-11 21:15<br>Since the information about the current job market is much more than I thought, it needs a seperate post.<br>Well, I am a Math&#x2F;IT student with few knowledge about Economics. So I just search in reddit to get some real example and maybe some insight. Since I am only in my early 20s, my observation of the job market is all in 2015-2021. Based on my poor knowledge, I guess some new technology akin to Ai will improve the situation. While what I can be sure about is there indeed won’t be any critical achievements in the bottleneck fields which could bring a evolution in the near future and AI’s development also slowed down due to the theoretical and hardware restrictions.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 21:29<br>Well, one thing I am confused about is, I haven’t saw any influence in daily life or purchasing, this is why I didn’t know about the recession except for viewing the job market. Some information I found:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is recently said the situation will last until the interest rates become lower, which might take 3-5 years.<br>This kinda surprised me, since 3-5 years isn’t a short time.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-11 21:40<br>2. Some one blamed at the sharehoulders, which is a new word for me. But his was criticized by another person saying “Inflation is caused by government, interests rates are raised to control the money in circulation. Sometimes layoff is necessary for company’s productive and it’s a much more complex issue.” The later is more reasonable, but I am more confused about the complexity mentioned. If it is periodic then it should be able to forecast to some degree.</p>

        <p>2024-05-12 12:05<br>Jerk couple talk and laugh through the corridor, of which the male sings or whisltes whenever walking in the corridor, making the educational building and classroom their hotel. This is certain to happen given the fact of the campus only has six majors without even a derpartment, only the ones without thoughts or without choices would come with the annual cost equal the foreign universities.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 12:12<br>In fact, I don’t like this anime. In 2021, I was lack of good anime and find it in the related animes of Cowboy Bebop.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 12:19<br>I picked GunxSword out of two reasons: 1. it has the same Executive Producer as Code Geass, who prevented Yiqilou Ohkouchi from making C.C and Charles to kiss, 2. its main character Van looks like Spike and shares some similiarities.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 12:25<br>But it turned out GunxSword is shallow and lack of thoughts, the only main theme I found was about the revange of the Claw without other things. A Notice is, I think this anime cannot be given to children. Because some plots are void and pointless, also a bad charater from which I couldn’t find any good thing and in fact I skipped some plots.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 12:33<br>Few things deserves mention are: 1. There is an okay character, a purely kindness girl but only a few plots. 2. The couple and the old heroes are good people with okay plots. 3. The only situation this anime can be suit for, I think, is related to personal loss and sorrow. Otherwise, this anime will disturb the mood. 4. Its OST is unique.</p>

        <p>2024-05-10 13:54<br>Recently I have regular left upper quadrant pain before and after meals only while walking. I had searched about to find fasting could related to it with pancreas problems. I knew about fasting in 2020 and I began fasting in 2021. Now I have a regular meal routine, two meals one is around 10:50 and another is around 16:50. From 202109-202206 I have a regular meal around 6:50 and then random one or two meals or none. My left upper quadrant pain for the first time occurred in 202204 usually in the afternoon, at which time I only had nuts besides meals.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 19:34<br>Now the pain occurs after meals and drinking water.</p>

        <p>2024-05-10 12:30<br>Since now I finally know about Department, Faculty and Professors, I want to use this knowledge to improve my choice of university. I want to figure out Q1: How does the Department and Faculty affect the degree programs? From the searching examples and my experience, a Professor’s research usually has nothing to do with the Professor’s degree courses. So I want to know whether there is no need to check about the Faculty if not doing research. Q2: I still didn’t find any rank of universities in specific Mathematics field. I am curious about Huangary’s reputation in Combinatorics and I wonder whether its universities are better in Combinatorics. </p>
<p>2024-05-10 14:16<br>Q3: I want to know more about the job market for Data Science&#x2F;Applied Mathematics. Since it is said there are global layoffs in IT&#x2F;tech, which makes the CSE&#x2F;SWE less lucrative. </p>
<p>2024-05-10 15:30<br>It is said in reddit when choosing a PhD the priorities are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The advisor</li>
<li>The reputation of department and school in the field</li>
<li>The location<br>But this brings the question back to how to know about the reputation of department and school in a specific field.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-10 15:34<br>Well, out of curiosity, I searched about universities’ Mathematics department though.</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ru.nl/en/departments/institute-for-mathematics-astrophysics-and-particle-physics/mathematics">https://www.ru.nl/en/departments/institute-for-mathematics-astrophysics-and-particle-physics/mathematics</a><br>Radboud University has the most pure Mathematics research in NL and it is the unique one combining Mathematics with Physics. However, it doesn’t focus on Graph theory nor Computer Science.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-10 21:32<br>In fact, Radboud University has the most Mathematics research in total, which I think also explains why its Data Science BSc has lots of academic writing.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 21:43<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ru.nl/en/institute-for-computing-and-information-sciences/research">https://www.ru.nl/en/institute-for-computing-and-information-sciences/research</a><br>So Radboud University set Data Science under the iCIS which has research focus on Software Science, Digital Security and Data Science.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 21:46<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://das.cs.ru.nl/Projects">https://das.cs.ru.nl/Projects</a><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v216/claassen23a.html">https://proceedings.mlr.press/v216/claassen23a.html</a><br>Their Data Science research focuses on applications of Data Science and the development of AI. I only find one publication about Graph theory which are part of improving the Algorithm.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 21:54<br>2. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics">https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics</a><br>It is said Leiden is strong in Mathematics, while its topics are less than Radbound. So Leiden has a unique Algebra, Geometry and Number Theory program.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 22:20<br>3. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/discrete-mathematics/publications/">https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/discrete-mathematics/publications/</a><br>   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/algebraic-combinatorics/persons/">https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/algebraic-combinatorics/persons/</a><br>So TU&#x2F;e has a Discete Mathematics research group focuses on data structure and algorithms and a smaller Algebraic Combinatorics group.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 22:30<br>4. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://qutech.nl/">https://qutech.nl/</a><br>   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/qutech">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/qutech</a><br>I didn’t find a Mathematics department in TUD, but they have a unique QuTech Institute.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 22:33<br>5. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/">https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/</a><br>RUG has a Bernoulli Institute but I didn’t find Group theory.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 22:48<br>For Q1, so the connection with the department and faculty is diverse. For a BSc student not doing research, the corriculum and the structure of the program are more important.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 06:38<br>Since PhD in EU normally requieres a Master degree, this comes back to the question of courses requirements, which can be modeled by a three-layer graph. So what really matters for the BSc’s study is corriculum. And knowing about knowledge involved in some research topics will be helpful.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 07:17<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/applied-mathematics/discrete-mathematics-optimization">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/applied-mathematics/discrete-mathematics-optimization</a><br>So there is an Applied Mathematics department in TUD and they do extremal combinatorics.<br>And I just find fingerprint is very useful for konwing about which topics are focused.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 07:27<br>Some publications in Graph theroy of TUD:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/the-ccap-for-graph-products-of-operator-algebras">https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/the-ccap-for-graph-products-of-operator-algebras</a><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/co-eigenvector-graphs">https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/co-eigenvector-graphs</a><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/complementarity-and-similarity-in-complex-networks">https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/complementarity-and-similarity-in-complex-networks</a><br>So I think a researcher in Graph theory usually has Spectral Graph theory in the theory side and Networks in the application side. I will like the topics in Spectral Graph theory with graphs and matrices.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 07:27<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://asp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13634-022-00960-6">https://asp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13634-022-00960-6</a><br>I haven’t read about Signal Processing nor Graph Time-series. So the motivation of the Applied aspect in Graph theory is to understand the underlying structure of the complex network and the evolution of Graph models which has some intersection with Ramsey theory.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 08:04<br>6. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/mathematics-centre-maastricht-mcm">https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/mathematics-centre-maastricht-mcm</a><br>As a reputational university well-known for Business and Economics. UM has fewer Technology research, its Mathematics centre is composed with Advanced Computer Sciences and Quantitative Economics.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 08:28<br>So UM only has research in Applied Mathematics focused on Operation Research, Game theory and Theoretical Computer Science.</p>

<p>2024-05-10 15:40<br>Some many wierd things, old women come into rooms daily to clean the air, young men come into the rooms weekly to “check and maintain” the never-used computer of the self-studying classroom. So they use the educational buildings to generate jobs and obviously layoff won’t be a problem here since all the managers are sitting in their each half-classroom large office in the six floor of another building never coming in the building.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 15:08<br>I actually just realized in a university I could go to lectures of topics I am interseted in. Guess Im too used to self-learning, since before and in a College there are only courses and exams as all the academic activities.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 11:44<br>So devoting in pure Mathematics will need 5 years to get into PhD position and to have the possibility to freely do research after 3 more years with no earning, while doing internship to start career after BSc is much more lucrative and prudent.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 11:56<br>In fact, in 2020 I thought the type of engagement of Mathematics I want is like Ramanujan or Erdos. Because I began the study and training of Mathematics Olympics late and hasty, from knowing nothing to being able to solve some questions and soomthly read textbooks within six months. I don’t have surprising genius, even nor able to catch up with the peers which mostly started learning MO as a kid with better surroundings. So I knew I just one of the Mathematics amateurs with love, learning, being inspired and trying to solve some puzzles.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 12:17<br>Another thought is, in my opinion, Mathematics gives one the most freedom to learn and even create, since doing Mathematics is mostly mental activities there are no limitations of experiments or labs like nature science. </p>
<p>2024-05-11 12:24<br>As for Graph theory, I think and conclude from recent searching that, it is always connected to the Applied aspect, from the beginning and during the evolution. But in theory it has its own compexity and fun. So I think the best starting point for me should be some industrial research related to Graph theory, which could both bring me some career experience and take me into the academic research of Graph theory.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 12:55<br>One thing I am sure about is I will study and live in a environment or community with Math amateurs and Math-minded people.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 13:07<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.stankova.net'/">http://www.stankova.net&#39;/</a><br>A great researcher. I think this should be the most helpful application of Mathematics. It’s pleasant to know about great researchers and be motivated to learn more.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 15:13<br>As for Q2, in reddit some said it’s due to the excellent Professors and then a positive cycle, while some said the relation is weak. Then I found a Hungary teacher’s insights, as there are lots of competitions which they can take part in from 11 years old. Since Combinatorics often doesn’t need Analysis or other university level Mathematics, it becomes the perfect topic for MO competitions. Plus the positive effect of the famous Hungarian Mathematicians, Hungary becomes a place where more people are good at Combinatorics. In conclusion, being good at Mathematics is mostly an outcome of early training and inherent interest, and for choosing educational programs the nationality is not directly related to being prominent.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 15:47<br>Also, one person said Hungary’s language has some advantage, I cannot test it currently.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 16:00<br>Q3 should be a important question. 1. It is said a lot of devs are replaced by automation, which I haven’t noticed since I am still learning the basic SWE. Well, I think this is a certain and natural result, as a new development of automation and part of the cycle of technology. After all, my BSc choice of CS from the beginning is for studying DS.’</p>
<p>2024-05-11 16:14<br>I just realize since the CS&#x2F;devs are over supply, some will not land a job then may go to study MS in DS. So this will make work experience&#x2F;YOE more important.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 19:50<br>I wonder how the job market will be in 3-4 years, but this question couldn’t have certain answer. I think if some new technology rises up, the market will get better. However, VR, which I had heard about in 2016 and focused on its newer name MR, IoT and wearable devices are all not hot enough to stmulate the market like AI did. So I think looking for jobs of other sections might be more helpful, as DS&#x2F;DA is broad in application.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 06:52<br>Weird though, recently I actually began to have some longing for feeling pride of a university, which I even never thought about back in my self-learning days.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 07:11<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/technische-wiskunde/bachelor-of-applied-mathematics/after-your-studies/career-opportunities">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/technische-wiskunde/bachelor-of-applied-mathematics/after-your-studies/career-opportunities</a><br>Well, I just found TUD has career suggestion for Applied Mathematics BSc to start PhD, which is contrary to the normal requirement of a Master. And I just found I haven’t learn about how will a Applied Mathematics BSc graduate’s work look like. Well, it is interesting sometimes when one is motivated, one can just sleep from 01:40 to 05:40 and then jump up not tired at all. </p>
<p>2024-05-12 07:17<br>I want to have earnings in my 30s, also I want to have Math in my life and work. So I initially choose Data Science for the impression that DS&#x2F;CS&#x2F;IT are good for jobs and salary. Well, now the job market are changing and recent motivation from the MO classmates really evokes and pushes me ahead, while in fact back.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 07:37<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/technische-wiskunde/bachelor-of-applied-mathematics">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelors/technische-wiskunde/bachelor-of-applied-mathematics</a><br>So it is taught in Dutch, while it has “100% material in English”. </p>
<p>2024-05-12 07:46<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/itav/education/dutch-courses/tu-delft-students/prospective-bachelor-students">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/itav/education/dutch-courses/tu-delft-students/prospective-bachelor-students</a><br>So they has a solution for this, while an additional year to only learn Dutch is not optimal.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 07:52<br>So proficient in Dutch on B2 level (or higher) is considered as Advanced knowledge.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 08:20<br>Some information from reddit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Applied Mathematics MSc doesn’t open more opportunities than BSc, which aligns with TUD’s suggestion.</li>
<li>Jobs for Applied Mathematics degree are still DS, Risk Analysis, etc. Also obviously, since these are basically the same. Applied Mathematics might have more in Math, while others are basically featured with domain knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-12 08:20<br>So I was motivated mainly by the courses in Complex and Geometry which I am weak in and the allowance of PhD. While giving a second thought, this two courses are all electives and the other courses are nearly the same as Data Science.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 08:36<br>And I just found this program is to some degree tailored for the dual degree with Physics. So one more answer for Q1, the Department designs and decides the program nearly totally, which will form the program’s purpose and the students’ experience, for example, some programs are tailored for research, some provide practice and some are used to gain finance while selling the title.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 08:50<br>All the desks and talking while walking, they actually can moing desks for two hours. The weekends are poor in quietness, even less the weekdays. At least this taught me a program will be stable so my experience in 2022 and the information from the former years are all timely. Still, I don’t have quiet place to read and had to move around, reality taught me.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 09:22<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/phd/phd-admission">https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/phd/phd-admission</a><br>So a Master degree is “must”.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 09:30<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/werken-bij-tu-delft/vacatures/details?jobId=17038&jobTitle=PhD%20Position%20Quantum%20Data%20Management%20%20%20%20%20%20">https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/werken-bij-tu-delft/vacatures/details?jobId=17038&amp;jobTitle=PhD%20Position%20Quantum%20Data%20Management%20%20%20%20%20%20</a><br>So PhD in EU needs a Master and is a job of doing research for the chosed topic with a Junior level salary. Compared to the reserch job in companies, PhD has academic environment, advanced topic and might be a preparation for freely research in the future. From the aspet of earning, PhD is not an optimal choice.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 09:37<br>By the way, I for the first time knew about Quantum era and I wonder when will I see its rise.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 09:41<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tue.nl/en/education/bachelor-college/bachelor-applied-mathematics/after-graduation">https://www.tue.nl/en/education/bachelor-college/bachelor-applied-mathematics/after-graduation</a><br>Career stats from TU&#x2F;e:<br>University: 20%<br>Information technology: 19%<br>Research institution: 10%<br>Continuing studies: 10%<br>Government: 9%<br>Consultancy:5%<br>Telecommunications: 4%<br>Banking sector: 4%<br>Self-employed: 2%<br>Well, I haven’t searched about research institution, the only ones I had saw belong to Universities.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 10:02<br>Now there is someone practicing instrument for the music class’s exam. It’s really a headache of the crowded College campus with jerk singing in the corridor.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 10:09<br>The jerk actually singing and walking around the corridor. This is what people do in a crowded campus selling titles to the students which have less choice and know nothing about there are only courses sometimes online without any opportunities, only a title after mechanical courses and exams.</p>
<p>2024-05-12 12:17<br>I really hate after saving my time as much as I could to find the rooms only have disturbance. </p>

        <p>2024-05-10 08:17<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://memorytreasures.com/blogs/news/story-of-healing">https://memorytreasures.com/blogs/news/story-of-healing</a><br>Well, I opened Quora and just happened to read this story. It got me in the end with the words and its insight.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 08:23<br>This reminds me that in fact, when I was a little kid around 5-6 years old, I sometimes lost my toys and then gradually I told myself the new one is the former’s incarnatioin with a new form. I think this is a common feeling, the dislike of loss and the nostalgia, though the degree varies among people, I appreciate this as a indicator of soft kind mind. As for toys, I only had small stuffed animal toys and made a stuffed animal toy when I was a kid and in a period without friends. Normally and molstly, I like toys of 百獣戦队ガオレンジャー, B-Robo Kabutack, The Gransazers and LEGO, whick really brought me lots of fun before Flash and Android games.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 08:45<br>This makes me wonder how will the Internet affect the childhood. There are huge differences between childhood with and without Internet. Essentially, current digital devices with the softwares facilitate the access of information in Internet. The benefit is there are always information to make decisions upon or know about new things, which could make children know more knowledge than the older generation. While at the same time, the problems of eyesight, poor gesture and the low-quality or even bad information also occur.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 09:10<br>Because Internet is in fact a vitural extension of the society. So there is the need of parents’ engagement and regulation. Nevertheless, the quality of the regulation is also uneven. But this is enough to erase the potential bad effects caused by Internet. Last but not least, I am still curios about the difference in minds between a person born with Internet access and the older generations.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 09:20<br>Well, reading more about Kafka reminds me the thoughts about loneliness. Loneliness and introversion really are catalyst for thinking. I have no talent in Literature and I always write as less as I can. Before writing blogs, I never write a complete sentence in private notes. But the boost in thinking is similiar. I always appreciate the introverts such as researchers and genius Mathematicians. Turing and Nash are all my idols.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 09:36<br>I thought loneliness is just a state, which can due to many social, environmental, cultural and personal reasons. Sometimes one may like to be alone for the thinking, studying or creavating. Sometimes the surroundings are not good, in which situation being engaged will bring not good experience. Since human beings are very diverse and uneven, one certainly cannot be happy with all kinds of environments or cultures. So simply judging someone of being too “alone” is obviously lack of thinking.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 09:44<br>So the problem is being extreme, which usually will bring some attention and regulation. But again, human beings are very diverse and the “normal” is just used for the middle of the spectum. In my opinion, this depends on the personal outcomes. For genius like Turing or Kafka, their work is of great importance so the personal traits is in their freedom as long as it doesn’t affect the society. And for normal persons, maybe one has his&#x2F;her own reasons so again as long as is doesn’t affect the society, it’s one’s freedom which needs patience and respect. </p>
<p>2024-05-10 09:57<br>As for Kafka’s opinion of marriage, I actually thought about it in 2020. I thought the society and the market usually need extroverts and the engagement with society tend to make one more extrovert. But this is not a binary classification, I think it’s better to use “the ability of social engagement” as a standard. A lot of people like to be in a quiet environment which usually need to be alone, but everyone has freedom in the spare time. So as long as one can smoothly engage the necessary social events, there should be no judgement. As for me, I am not a genius but I like quietness. And I also want to find a right person to build a family, so in 2020 I came up with a solution of living together while causing no disturbance. Firstly, living in separate rooms will make sure keeping the private space. Then for the chores, an appointment is needed to set a regular timetable, which will make daily with claer schedule to plan upon. When there is something out of the plan, if is is emergent then this is the necessary disturbance, otherwise I came up with a message propose: sending messages and plan to meet when both have spare time. </p>
<p>2024-05-10 10:20<br>It can be written like this:<br>In the house:<br>  Sepatately in each room<br>  if emergency:<br>    necessary disturbance<br>  else:<br>    if both have spare time and A wants to meet and B wants to meet:<br>      do things together</p>
<p>2024-05-10 10:26<br>Of crouse this is incomplete, if there is a kid then in the early years there are necessary disturbances. And this will gradually become a new schedule or a new routine.</p>

        <p>2024-05-11 13:27<br>“To be young is a feeling.” a line of my eighteen<br>Usually children are simple, teenagers are diverse, not stable and with rapid changes due to hormone, biological growth, growth of thoughts and mind and partially engagement of the society, then one becomes an adult, independent, begins one’s life with a relatively stable mind, gaining knowledge and lessons along the way. </p>
<p>2024-05-11 13:43<br>As a naural process, being old brings wisdom and mature. However, these are not always equvalent. Being mature is a process of experincing, thinking and taking actions, which is in fact independent of the age. Age is a symbol of the one-direction property of the time, which just happen to record the time past. An example is the unique movie, The Curious case of Benjamin Button. Well, essentially this is due to the human’s nature in the ancient time of depending mainly on the visual information. </p>
<p>2024-05-11 13:55<br>This explains some indivuals are more mature than the peers. An example, in anime, is あやのこうじ きよたか&#x2F;Kiyotaka Ayanokōji, which is just the explanation of how the growth environment could catalyst one’s mature in mind.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 14:07<br>In fact, many animes have this kind of character, Lelouch is an eternal paragon of a good brother, which also makes him more mature. In HunterxHunter, the older two talk more while the younger two are more energetic and dash around. In Ghost in The Shell, every main character is mature but Major evolved to a higher lever. In Cowboy Bebop, only Ed and Ein are the happy and innocent one.</p>
<p>2024-05-11 14:19<br>In my opinion, being mature means learning to deal with pains, sorrow, mistakes, all the likes and dislikes, having clear, prudent and sometimes dynamic plans, playing all the roles in one’s life and being strong mentally, physically and academically. When I was a kid, I often complain my father’s memory is poor. Then I gradually found I can understand more with more experience but I will do better.</p>

        <p>2024-05-09 12:30<br>Viewing the positions of PhD in Mathematics, I found the current main topics are 1. Algebraic Geometry, 2. Topology, 3. Combinatorics (and Quantum information), 4. (Dynamic) Networks, 5. Arithmetic Geometry and 6. Probability and Statistics&#x2F;Machine Learning.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 12:46<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://euromathsoc.org/jobs">https://euromathsoc.org/jobs</a><br>So this is where to find PhD positions.</p>

While by country US and UK are the most.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 13:02<br>So “A postdoc is a temporary research position after a PhD that prepares young researchers for their academic career.”, this explains the restrict in age. But for me, PhD isn’t a prudent choice to start my career.</p>

<p>2024-05-09 13:19<br>Since Im at the crossing now, I want to make a choice which could support both my career and love for Mathematics. Viewing the requirements of the positions, I have to say my BSc for career is insufficient. After all, how could a BSc other than Mathematics offer Algebra courses.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 13:29<br>As for my knowledge in Mathematics, I had great scores in Calculus, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics and Probability theory and Statistics, which are all the Mathematics I can get from a CSE BSc.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 13:34<br>Besides the academic courses, I only have books to read. I had read and got a good understanding of Real Analysis, Ramsey theory, Counting theory, basic Complex Analysis, Projective Geometry, Multi-version Geometry, Point-set Topology, Abstract Algebra, Number theory, Machine Learning, Heuristic Optimization, Graph theory, The Book, Inference and Bayesian Statistics.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 14:.  32<br>Besides the courses in my program, I didn’t do exercises in the textbooks for more time to read more. So I have no training except for using the learned knowledge to understand new material, which I thought is more efficient for my purpose of reading and understanding.<br>And I haven’t have a command of manifolds. I am weak at Analysis and Algebraic Geometry. I will learn more Applied Mathematics in a Data Sciencce BSc and get academic grades, such as Numerical Methods, Graph Theory, Simulation Modeling, Game Theory, Operation Research, Statistic Analysis and Theoretical Computer Science.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 14:54<br>There will be some electives depending on the program, which are mostly in Applied Mathematics or Computer Science. I find Quantum Computing&#x2F;Quantum Information is the most advanced elective course. And this could support the PhD research in Graph theory and Quantum Information.<br>So the courses of DS BSc are good for career and could lead to an Applied Mathematics position. If I want to do pure Mathematics PhD I will definitely need a Master in Mathematics. Now I need to know more about Q1. the Quantum Information, Q2. Industrial PhD and Q3. the requirements of Master, since I might do research in Graph theory in theoretical Computer Science with less requirements in Algebra and I could be certain I would only do Master after having a job.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 15:17</p>
<ol>
<li>For Quantum Information, I like Quantum mechanism as a door of the future but the interest is not strong enough to devote in its research. So it attracts me for the “Graph theory”, “Information” and the last, its own fanciness.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-09 15:24<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/59370/items/1.0040942#:~:text=Discrete%20quantum%20walks%20are%20defined%20on%20graphs.%20Graph,are%20related%20to%20classical%20problems%20in%20graph%20theory">https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/59370/items/1.0040942#:~:text=Discrete%20quantum%20walks%20are%20defined%20on%20graphs.%20Graph,are%20related%20to%20classical%20problems%20in%20graph%20theory</a>.<br>So Graph theory in Quantum information isn’t a recent topic and I just knew about it.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 15:28<br>So in fact Quantum Computing is theoretical Computer Science + Algorithms + Quantum mechanism. For me, this is better than theoretical Physics and Probability theory and Statistics, while it seems less about Graph theory itself. So I will view it as a choice similiar to Brain Science + Graph theory as a STEM PhD, only consider it if it doesn’t need a Master.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 16:40<br>2. In fact, this is again the wish to do Math while earn more money. And “industrial PhD” will definitely be more in Applied Mathematics, unless some research institutes or labs but this comes back to 1. While viewing reddit, I found this kind of question always leads to Quant and now I know there are lots of people in the same ship.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 16:44<br>3. So as a result, maybe I will look for PhD positions in US without Master degree. And I will always be a Math amateur. I really need a real university to know about the research environment and PhD in Mathematics in person.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 18:08<br>Last but not least reason for Mathematics PhD is that I like to be around with Math mind people or at least the people loving theories, and I know with the highest likelihood I will find the right person related to pure Mathematics. Obviously, a Math mind person will find like-minded people in a Mathematics community. </p>
<p>2024-05-09 19:19<br>Also, I very enjoy being around with talented and motivated people. Back when I was in a Mathematics Olympics program, I met the most intellegent and awesome classmates I had ever saw and had a good time with lots of friends, talking about Math puzzles, new tricks and books and daily small talks. I never felt bored with all the chanllenges, since we had the work load as twice as the normal students. But the most important thing is we can always have new knowledge to learn and puzzles to think of, this made the load worthwhile and everyone was happy and excited everyday. The 1st of us could even tell interesting jokes with Physics, which I still remember today. </p>
<p>2024-05-09 19:39<br>On the flip side, the program is selective, competitive with the over study load and unmatched possible outcome. So I had the most stressful time in the selecting period, especially after I realized half of the students had prepared ahead while I was totally new to all the courses. However, I gradually caught up, though with less sleep and a very intensive timetable. But if there is a similiar program I will choose without any hesitation, because in the end I really learned a lot from all the excellent top students.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 19:52<br>So in fact there is a similiar question in reddit: “r&#x2F;sysor Operations Research PhD?”. Well, its title doesn’t include Graph theory, neither does mine.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 20:00<br>So some notes are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many OR problems involve Graphs and OR is diverse.</li>
<li>OR could be under different departments, such as Economics and Management in Bussiness school, Mathematics and Computer Science.</li>
<li>So one can choose research topics with a lot of freedom as a Professor, while a PhD is still a academic program.</li>
<li>Finding a PhD advisor is important.</li>
<li>Most OR&#x2F;IE PhD programs do faculty-oriented admissions and therefore finding an advisor whose work one is interested in is important, since one will work with the advisor.</li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-09 20:13<br>So now I finally know choosing a PhD is more about choosing a faculty and a Professor. There are some professors recommanded in a reddit Q&amp;A five years ago (r&#x2F;math “Where to learn about spectral graph theory”)</p>
<ol>
<li>Dr. Fan Chung<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chung/">https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chung/</a></li>
</ol>
<p>2024-05-09 20:32<br>Wow, very excellent and genius Mathematician paragon before the Age of Information. _1. So Graph theory found its applied counterpart in Internet and therefore had a emergence. Since Graph is a very general object, I think the emergence occurred with Internet and Bell Communications Research is due to the fact that these are the first complicated and man made networks, other than the soical networks which are not easy to conduct research and the Biological networks which need advanced tools.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 20:54<br>_2. A brief overview of Dr. Fan Chung’s career path, Mathematics BSc-&gt; M.S. and PhD at the University of Pennsylvania-&gt;a job as a member of Technical Staff working for the Mathematical Foundations of Computing Department at Bell Laboratories-&gt; Division Manager of Mathematics, Informations Sciences and Operations Research at Bellcore in 1986-&gt;1989 visiting professor at Princeton marked the beginning of a new association with the academic world-&gt;back to academic world<br>_3. Another legendary with Erdos.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 20:56<br>2. prof.dr.ir Willem Haemers (emeritus)</p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:14<br>_1. Publications of Willem Haemers are mostly theoretical and focused on the spectral Graph theory, while he woked in the Department of Econometrics and Operation Research in the Tilburg School of Economics and Management. So he should conducted the Graph theory courses, but there is no information of his career. _2. His early publications in 1980s were related to Traffic Engineering in Communication Networks and Telecommunications Services. So Networks are in the basic topics of a Graph theory researcher.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:27<br>3. Vladimir Nikiforov<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://umwa.memphis.edu/fcv/viewcv.php?personUUID=vnikifrv">https://umwa.memphis.edu/fcv/viewcv.php?personUUID=vnikifrv</a><br>He got MS in Mathematics and Computer Science in 1978 and PhD in Computer Science in 2004, then became a professor in “Math Science” in 2012. So this is a more normal example of academic career path. And although he didn’t get degrees in pure Mathematics, his publications are still in Grapg theory. This gives me some comfort.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:32<br>4. Professor Steve Kirkland<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://server.math.umanitoba.ca/%7Ekirkland/">https://server.math.umanitoba.ca/%7Ekirkland/</a><br>A younger Professor with publications in Quantum Computing.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:42<br>5. Professor Paul Horn<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cs.du.edu/~paulhorn/">https://cs.du.edu/~paulhorn/</a></p>
<p>2024-05-10 07:55<br>So Professor Paul Horn’s research interests are very attracting for me, spectral graph theory, probabilistic combinatorics and their applications in the study of complex networks and extremal graph theory.</p>
<p>2024-05-10 08:03<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cs.du.edu/~paulhorn/scary2.jpg">https://cs.du.edu/~paulhorn/scary2.jpg</a><br>I also love these two formulas. </p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:44<br>6. Professor Daniel A. Spielman<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/">https://cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/</a><br>So the research topics are changing as the evolving of science and technlogy, especially in Applied Mathematics.</p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:47<br>7. Dr. Steve Butler</p>
<p>2024-05-09 21:50<br>So now I know I should start with Dr. Fan Chung’s publications and gain more insights in Graph theory and the Ramsy theory. Then I think I should know the next step. Also, I will learn more about Networks during the BSc in Data Science.</p>

        <p>2024-05-08 22:08<br>It is said being a professor after a Mathematics PhD is very hard and it seems the only benefit of doing a Math PhD, especially in pure Mathematics, is having the freedom and the full-time to devote into the interested Mathematics field or Math puzzle. However, this is a very ideal thought without any budget in time or earning, even without the possibility of the difficulties in the chosen topic. And as what I have searched today, this might be not practical since there will be a supervisor. </p>
<p>2024-05-08 22:22<br>So the key point is the theoretical and complicated nature of Mathematics puzzles. I was inspired by Erdos and Penrose in 2020 and their stories along with many other long lasting Math puzzles’ stories made me realize solving Mathematical puzzles are more like a lifelong hobby, since it doesn’t like practical problems with clear deadline and timeliness which therefore always have a ending.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 22:30<br>So in 2020 I chose to keep Mathematics as a lifelong hobby. Apparantly I was too young to understand the meaning of “lifelong”. In year1 I just wanted to read Mathematics I liked as much as I could, because at which time I found the CSE major has too limited contents in Mathematics. There was not a program courses overview before getting into the campus. So I was too focused on sparing time and reading to find whether there were other choices until 202404.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 22:38<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/44244/what-recent-discoveries-have-amateur-mathematicians-made/">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/44244/what-recent-discoveries-have-amateur-mathematicians-made/</a><br>Now I finally searched about Mathematics again and I found the examples of Math amateurs with discoveries are not really not “amateur”. </p>
<p>2024-05-08 22:42<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gregegan.net/">https://www.gregegan.net/</a><br>Greg Egan is definitely in the community of science and Mathematics.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 22:44<br>So now I finally realized the key point is to engaging in the Math community, keep reading and trying and having the basics in Mathematics. (In a JD way, having BSc&#x2F;MSc level of Mathematics or STEM.) Last but not least, the culture and environment are also important. I always think doing pure Math is in fact or should be a leisure process with no timeline and a math&#x2F;science community&#x2F;locally or online culture could make one keeps in the context with new feeds or inspiration.</p>
<p>2024-05-08 22:54<br>Unfortunately these are all what I don’t have currently, so I will settle down first.</p>
